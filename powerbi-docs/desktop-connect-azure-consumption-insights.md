# Connect to Azure Consumption Insights data in Power BI desktop

You can use Power BI desktop to connect to Azure and get in-depth data about your organization's Azure service usage. With this data, you can create custom reports and measures to better understand and analyze your Azure spend.

> [!NOTE]
> There is limited support for the Microsoft Azure Consumption Insights (Beta). For new functionality, use the [Azure Cost Management connector for Power BI](desktop-connect-azure-cost-management.md).

## Connect with Azure Consumption Insights

Azure Consumption Insights allows you to connect to Azure Enterprise Agreement billing accounts.

In this section, you learn how to get the data you need migrate using the Azure Enterprise Connector. You'll also find a *usage details columns* mapping available in the **ACI** (Azure Consumption Insights) API.

To successfully use the **Azure Consumption Insights** connector, you need access to the Azure portal Enterprise features.

To use the **Azure Consumption Insights** connector in **Power BI Desktop**: 

1. From the **Home** ribbon, select **Get Data**.

1. From the categories on the left, select **Online Services**.  

1. Select **Microsoft Azure Consumption Insights (Beta)**. 

1. Select **Connect**.

   In the dialog that appears, enter your **Azure Enrollment Number**.

   ![](media/desktop-connect-azure-consumption-insights/azure-consumption-insights_02.png)

   * You can get your enrollment number from the [Azure Enterprise Portal](https://ea.azure.com), in the location shown in the following image:

  ![](media/desktop-connect-azure-consumption-insights/azure-consumption-insights_08.png)

   This connector version only supports enterprise enrollments from https://ea.azure.com. China enrollments aren't currently supported.

   Next, provide your *Access key* to connect.

   ![](media/desktop-connect-azure-consumption-insights/azure-consumption-insights_03.png)

   * Your Access key for enrollment can be found on the [Azure Enterprise Portal](https://ea.azure.com).

  ![](media/desktop-connect-azure-consumption-insights/azure-consumption-insights_09.png)

Once you provide your *Access key* and select **Connect**, a **Navigator** window appears and shows nine available tables:

| Table        | Description |
|------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Budgets** | Budget details to view actual costs or usage against existing budget targets. |
| **MarketPlace** | Usage-based Azure Marketplace charges. |
| **PriceSheets** | Applicable rates by meter for an enrollment. |
| **RICharges** | Charges associated to your Reserved Instances over the last 24 months. |
| **RIRecommendations_Single** | Reserved Instance purchase recommendations based on your single subscription usage trends over the last 7, 30, or 60 days. |
| **RIRecommendations_Shared** | Reserved Instance purchase recommendations based on your usage trends across all your subscriptions over the last 7, 30 or 60 days. |
| **RIUsage** | Consumption details for your existing Reserved Instances over the last month. |
| **Summaries** | A monthly summary for balances, new purchases, Azure Marketplace service charges, adjustments, and overage charges. |
| **UsageDetails** | A consumed quantities breakdown and estimated enrollment charges. |

You can select a checkbox beside any table to see a preview. You can select one or more tables by checking the box beside their name, then select **Load**.

![](media/desktop-connect-azure-consumption-insights/azure-consumption-insights_04b.png)

> [!NOTE]
> The *Summary* and *PriceSheet* tables are only available for the enrollment-level API Key. Also, the data in these tables has, by default, the current month's data for *Usage* and *PriceSheet*. The *Summary* and *MarketPlace* tables are not constrained to the current month.
>

When you select **Load**, the data is loaded into **Power BI Desktop**.

![](media/desktop-connect-azure-consumption-insights/azure-consumption-insights_05.png)

Once the data you selected is loaded, the tables and fields you selected can be seen in the **Fields** pane.

![](media/desktop-connect-azure-consumption-insights/azure-consumption-insights_06.png)

## Using Azure Consumption Insights
To use the **Azure Consumption Insights** connector, you access to the Azure portal Enterprise features.

Once you successfully load data using the **Azure Consumption Insights** connector, you can create your own custom measures and columns using **Query Editor**. You can also create visuals, reports, and dashboards for sharing in the **Power BI service**.

With a blank query, you can retrieve a sample Azure custom queries collection. There are two ways you can do this retrieval: 

In **Power BI Desktop**: 

1. Select the **Home** ribbon 
2. Select **Get Data** > **Blank Query** 

Or, in **Query Editor**: 

1. Right-click in the left **Queries** pane 
2. Select **New Query > Blank Query** from the menu that appears

In the **Formula bar**, type:

    = MicrosoftAzureConsumptionInsights.Contents

The following image shows a samples collection that appears.

![](media/desktop-connect-azure-consumption-insights/azure-consumption-insights_07.png)

When working with reports and creating queries, you can:

* To define the number of months starting from the current date, use *numberOfMonth*
  * Use a value between one and 36. Represent the number of months, from the current date, you want to import. We recommend getting no more than 12 months of data. This limit avoids Power BI query import constraints and data volume thresholds.
* To define a period of months in a historical time window, use *startBillingDataWindow* and *endBillingDataWindow*
* Don't use *numberOfMonth* together with *startBillingDataWindow* or *endBillingDataWindow*

## Migrate from the Azure Enterprise Connector

Some customers created visuals using the *Azure Enterprise Connector (Beta)*. Eventually, it will be replaced with the **Azure Consumption Insights** connector. The new connector has features and enhancements that include:

* Additional data sources available for *Balance Summary* and *Marketplace Purchases*
* New and advanced parameters, such as *startBillingDataWindow* and *endBillingDataWindow*
* Better performance and responsiveness

The next steps show how to transition to the **Azure Consumption Insights** connector. These steps preserve the work you've already done in creating custom dashboards or reports.

### Step 1: Connect to Azure using the new connector
The first step is use the **Azure Consumption Insights** connector described in detail earlier in this article. In this step, select **Get Data > Blank Query** from the **Home** ribbon in **Power BI Desktop**.

### Step 2: Create a query in Advanced Editor
In **Query Editor**, select **Advanced Editor** from the **Home** ribbon's **Query** section. In the **Advanced Editor** window that appears, enter this query:

    let    
        enrollmentNumber = "100",
        optionalParameters = [ numberOfMonth = 6, dataType="DetailCharges" ],
        data = MicrosoftAzureConsumptionInsights.Contents(enrollmentNumber, optionalParameters)   
    in     
        data

![](media/desktop-connect-azure-consumption-insights/azure-consumption-insights_10.png)

You'll need to replace the *enrollmentNumber* value with your enrollment number. You can get your number from the [Azure Enterprise Portal](https://ea.azure.com). The *numberOfMonth* parameter is how many months of data you want going back, from the current dat. Use zero (0) for the current month.

Once you select **Done** in the **Advanced Editor** window, the preview refreshes and data from the specified month range appears in the table. Select **Close & Apply** and return.

### Step 3: Move measures and custom columns to the new report
Next, you'll need to move any custom columns or measures you created into the new details table. Here are the steps.

1. Open Notepad (or another text editor).
2. Select the measure you want to move, copy the text from the *Formula* field, and place it in Notepad.

   ![](media/desktop-connect-azure-consumption-insights/azure-consumption-insights_11.png)
3. Rename *Query1* to the original details table name.
4. To create new table measures and custom columns, right-click on your table, and choose **New Measure**. Then, cut and paste your stored measures and columns until they're all done.

### Step 4: Relink tables that had relationships
Many dashboards have additional tables that are used for lookup or filtering, such as date tables or tables used for custom projects. Reestablishing those relationships resolves most remaining issues. Here's how to do it.

- In the **Modeling** tab in **Power BI Desktop**, select **Manage Relationships** to bring up a window that lets you manage relationships within the model. Relink your tables, as needed.

    ![](media/desktop-connect-azure-consumption-insights/azure-consumption-insights_12.png)

### Step 5: Verify your visuals, and adjust field formatting as needed
At this point, most of your original visuals, tables, and drill-downs should be working as expected. Some minor tweaks may be necessary, however, to precisely format the look and feel. Take a bit of time to look over each of your dashboards and visuals to ensure they look how you want them.

## Using the Azure Consumption and Insights (ACI) API to get consumption data
Azure also provides the [**Azure Consumption and Insights (ACI) API**](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/announcing-general-availability-of-consumption-and-charge-apis-for-enterprise-azure-customers/). You can create your own custom solutions to gathering, reporting, and visualizing Azure consumption information using the ACI API.

### Mapping names and usage details between the portal, the connector, and the API
The Azure portal columns and details names are similar in the API and the connector, though not always identical. To help clarify, the following table provides a mapping. Also indicated is whether the column is obsolete. For more information, and term definitions, see the [Azure billing data dictionary](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-enterprise-api-usage-detail).
