# CI/CD for org apps in Fabric (Preview)

This article explains how [Git integration](/fabric/cicd/git-integration/intro-to-git-integration) and [deployment pipelines](/fabric/cicd/deployment-pipelines/intro-to-deployment-pipelines) work for [org apps](./org-app-items.md) in Microsoft Fabric. Learn how to set up a connection to your repository, manage your org app through Git, and deploy it across different environments.

## Org apps and Git integration

### Connect to a Git repository

From your workspace settings, set up a connection to your repo to commit and sync changes. To set up the connection, see [Get started with Git integration](/fabric/cicd/git-integration/git-get-started) article. 

After you connect, the workspace displays information about source control that allows you to view the connected branch, the status of each item in the branch, and the time of the last sync.

### Org apps representation in Git

When you commit the org app item to the Git repo, a folder is created for each item and named  `{display name}.OrgApp`. It contains two files:

- `.platform` file which is auto generated by the system. Learn more from [system file](../../cicd/git-integration/source-code-format.md#automatically-generated-system-files).
- `definition.json` file which is the definition of the org app item. 
<!--- Learn more about [Mirrored database item definition](/rest/api/fabric/articles/item-management/definitions/mirrored-database-definition) --->

The definition file contains:

- Settings
  - Theme
    - Background
    - Foreground
    - BackgroundHover
    - BackgroundSelected
    - BackgroundPressed
- Elements
  - ElementType
  - ElementId
  - ItemType
  - ItemLogicalId
  - isHidden
  - DisplayName 

The following JSON code is an example of the `definition.json` file for an org app item:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/fabric/item/orgapp/definition/orgAppDefinition/1.0.0/schema.json",
  "settings": {
    "theme": {
      "background": "#2fb136",
      "foreground": "#000000",
      "backgroundHover": "#59c15e",
      "backgroundSelected": "#82d086",
      "backgroundPressed": "#ace0af"
    }
  },
  "elements": [
    {
      "elementType": "item",
      "elementId": "08e649a9-0fe6-40bd-b0c3-7fc900b7550f",
      "itemType": "Report",
      "itemLogicalId": "e0fa7df4-5528-4c37-bf2c-9ec02ffef18d",
      "isHidden": false,
      "displayName": "Daily Dashboard"
    },
    {
      "elementType": "item",
      "elementId": "410f87ee-8402-49b0-abbb-31cb69dc1ebc",
      "itemType": "SemanticModel",
      "itemLogicalId": "8f633535-6fb4-467f-a668-6bc55c5735b8",
      "isHidden": false,
      "displayName": "410f87ee-8402-49b0-abbb-31cb69dc1ebc"
    }
  ]
}
```
