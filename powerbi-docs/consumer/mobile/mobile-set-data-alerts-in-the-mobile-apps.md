You can set alerts on dashboards in the Power BI mobile apps and in the Power BI service. Alerts notify you when data in a tile changes beyond limits you set. Alerts work for tiles featuring a single number, such as cards and gauges, but not with streaming data. You can set data alerts on your mobile device and see them in the Power BI service, and vice versa. Only you can see the data alerts you set, even if you share a dashboard or a snapshot of a tile.

You can set alerts on tiles if you have a Power BI Pro license, or if the shared dashboard is in a Premium capacity. 

> [!WARNING]
> Data-driven alert notifications provide information about your data. If your device gets stolen, we recommend going to the Power BI service to turn off all data-driven alert rules.

## Receiving alerts
You receive alerts in the Power BI [Notification Center](mobile-apps-notification-center.md) on your mobile device or in the Power BI service, along with notifications about new dashboards that someone has shared with you.

Data sources are often set to refresh daily, although some refresh more often. When the data in the dashboard is refreshed, if the data being tracked reaches one of the thresholds you've set, several things will happen.

1. Power BI checks to see if it's been more than an hour or more than 24 hours (depending on the option you selected) since the last alert was sent.
   
   As long as the data is past the threshold, you'll get an alert every hour or every 24 hours.
2. If you've set the alert to send you an email, you'll find something like this in your Inbox.
   
   ![](media/mobile-set-data-alerts-in-the-mobile-apps/powerbi-alerts-email.png)
3. Power BI adds a message to your **Notification center** and adds a new alert icon to the applicable tile ![](media/mobile-set-data-alerts-in-the-mobile-apps/powerbi-alert-tile-notification-icon.png).
4. Tap the global navigation button ![](./media/mobile-set-data-alerts-in-the-mobile-apps/power-bi-iphone-alert-global-nav-button.png) to [open your **Notification center**](mobile-apps-notification-center.md) and see the alert details.

> [!NOTE]
> Alerts only work on data that is refreshed. When data refreshes, Power BI looks to see if an alert is set for that data. If the data has reached an alert threshold, an alert is triggered.

## Tips and troubleshooting
* Alerts currently aren't supported for Bing tiles or card tiles with date/time measures.
* Alerts only work with numeric data.
* Alerts only work on data that is refreshed. They don't work on static data.
* Alerts don't work with tiles that contain streaming data.
