When you open Power BI Mobile app, you land on the home page, where you have quick access to your most frequently or recently visited reports, dashboards, and apps. In addition, there is an activity feed that keeps you up-to-date about what's happening with your Power BI content, as well as convenient navigation aids to get you quickly to the content you need.

## Quick Access tab

The quick access tab shows you your frequently and recently viewed reports, dashboards, and apps, grouped into two collapsible sections. To see a longer list of your recently viewed items, tap **See all** to the right of Recents. 

## Activity feed

The activity feed helps you keep track of what's happening with your Power BI content. It shows you all your latest notifications, alerts, comments, and @mentions.

![Activity feed](./media/mobile-apps-home-page/powerbi-mobile-app-activity.png)

The updates in the feed include:
* **Refreshed data**: when the underlying data in one of the reports or dashboards in your favorites or recents is refreshed.
* **New comments**: when people create a comment in a report or a dashboard that is in your favorites or recents, or when someone mentions you in a comment.
* **Data alerts**: when data reaches a threshold you previously set in a [data alert](../../mobile-set-data-alerts-in-the-mobile-apps.md).
* **App updates**: when an app creator publishes an update to an app you are using.

 Tap on an activity item to jump to the relevant place in order to explore further.

Activity items are aggregated, so all data updates coming from the same app or workspace will be grouped together. Use the ![expand arrow](./media/mobile-apps-home-page/powerbi-mobile-app-expand-arrow.png) arrow to expand and see the aggregated items. The most recent item will always be at the top of the list.
