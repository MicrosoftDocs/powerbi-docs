When you open Power BI Mobile app, you land on the home page, where you have quick access to your most frequently or recently visited reports, dashboards, apps, etc., an activity feed that keeps you up-to-date with real-time info about what's happening with your Power BI content, and convenient navigation aids to get you quickly to the content you need.

## Quick Access tab

The quick access tab shows you your frequently and recently viewed reports, dashboards, and apps, grouped into two collapsible sections. To see a longer list of your recently viewed items, tap **See all** to the right of Recents. 

## Activity tab

The activity tab helps you keep track of what's happening with your Power BI content, in real time. The activity feed shows you all your latest notifications, alerts, comments, @mentions, etc. The updates in the feed include:
* **Refreshed data**: when the underlying data in your reports and dashboards is refreshed.
* **New comments**: when people create a comment in a report or a dashboard, or when someone mentions you in a comment.
* **Data alerts**: when data reaches a threshold you previously set in a [data alert](../../mobile-set-data-alerts-in-the-mobile-apps.md).
* **App updates**: when an app creator publishes an update to an app you are using.

Tap on an activity item to jump to the relevant place in order to explore further. 

Activity items are aggregated, so all data updates coming from the same app or workspace will be grouped together. Use the ![expand arrow](./media/mobile-apps-home-page/powerbi-mobile-app-expand-arrow.png) arrow to expand and see the aggregated items. The most recent item will always be at the top of the list.

## Navigation bar

At the bottom of the page you find the navigation bar, which provides quick access to:
* **Favorites** - the reports, dashboards and apps you have marked as [favorites](../../mobile-apps-favorites.md).
* **Apps** - the apps you have installed in your account.
* **Workspaces** - the working folders that keep together reports and dashboards that content creators are building.
* **Recents** - the items you have recently viewed.
* **Shared with me** - the items other people have shared with you.
* **Samples**: Power BI samples you can use to learn about Power BI capabilities.
* **Scanner**: the device camera that you can use as a scanner to scan [barcodes](../../mobile-apps-scan-barcode-iphone.md) and [QR codes](../../mobile-apps-qr-code.md).

## Header

At the top of the page, the header shows the name of the page of the Power BI report or dashboard you're on, and provides the following navigation items:
* **Profile picture or avatar**: opens the side panel where you can [switch between your Power BI service and Report Server accounts](../../mobile-app-ssrs-kpis-mobile-on-premises-reports.md), as well as access Power BI mobile app settings.
