# View reports and dashboards in presentation mode on Surface Hub and Windows 10 devices
You can use presentation mode to display reports and dashboards in full-screen on Windows 10 devices and Surface Hub. 

![Report in full-screen mode](./media/mobile-windows-10-app-presentation-mode/power-bi-presentation-mode-2.png)

Presentation mode is useful for displaying Power BI at a meeting or conference, or on a dedicated projector at the office, or even just for maximizing space on a small screen. 

In presentation mode in the Power BI mobile app for Windows 10, all the "chrome", such as the navigation and menu bars, is removed to make it easier for you and your team members to focus on the data in your report. An action toolbar becomes available to enable you to interact with your data and to control the presentation.

You can also [display dashboards and reports in full-screen mode from the Power BI service](../end-user-focus.md) on the web.

> [!NOTE]
> Presentation mode is different from [focus mode for tiles](mobile-tiles-in-the-mobile-apps.md).

>[!NOTE]
>Power BI mobile app support for **phones using Windows 10 Mobile** will be discontinued on March 16, 2021. [Learn more](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2121400)

## Use presentation mode
In the Power BI mobile app, tap the **Full screen** icon to go to full-screen mode.

The app chrome disappears and the action toolbar appears at the bottom of the screen or on the right and left sides (depending on your screen size).

You can undock the toolbar and drag and drop it to anywhere on the screen. This is useful for large screens, when you want to focus on a specific area in your report and want to have the tools available next to it. Just place your finger on the toolbar and swipe it into the report canvas.
