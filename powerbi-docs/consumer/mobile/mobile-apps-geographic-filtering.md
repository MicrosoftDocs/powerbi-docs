When you look at a Power BI report on your mobile device, do you see a little pushpin icon in the upper-right corner? If so, then you can filter that report based on your geographic location.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only filter by location if the geographic names in the report are in English; for example, "New York City" or "Germany". Windows 10 tablets and PCs don't support geographic filtering, but Windows 10 phones do.

## Filter your report by your geographic location
1. Open a report in the Power BI mobile app on your mobile device.
2. If the report has geographic data, you see a message asking to allow Power BI to access your location. Click **Allow**, then tap **Allow** again.
3. Tap the push pin ![Push pin icon](./media/mobile-apps-geographic-filtering/power-bi-mobile-geo-icon.png). You can filter by city, state/province, or country/region, depending on the data in the report. The filter only lists options that match your current location.

## Why don't I see location tags on a report?
All three of the conditions below must be met for you to see location tags. 

* The person who created the report in Power BI Desktop  must have [categorized geographical data](../../desktop-mobile-geofiltering.md) for at least one column, such as City, State, or Country/Region.
* You are in one of the locations that has data in that column.
* You're using one of these mobile devices:
  * iOS (iPad, iPhone, iPod).
  * Android (phone, tablet).
  * Windows 10 phone (other Windows 10 devices such as PCs and tablets don't support geographic filtering).
