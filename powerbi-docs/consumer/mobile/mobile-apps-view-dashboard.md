# View dashboards in the Power BI mobile apps

**Applies to:** iPhone | iPad | Android phone | Android tablet

Dashboards provide a single place to monitor the current state of your business. Use the Power BI mobile apps to view and interact with your dashboards on any device.

## Before you begin

Mobile apps are designed for viewing and interacting with dashboards, not creating them. Before you can view dashboards on your mobile device:

1. [Sign up for a Power BI account](../../fundamentals/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi.md) if you don't have one.
1. [Create dashboards](../../fundamentals/service-get-started.md) or [connect to existing Power BI apps](../../connect-data/service-connect-to-services.md) in the Power BI service at [https://www.powerbi.com](https://www.powerbi.com).

Once you have dashboards in your Power BI account, they automatically sync to the mobile apps.

## View and interact with dashboards

[Download the mobile app](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=522062) for your device and sign in to get started.

### Open a dashboard

1. From the home screen, tap a dashboard to open it.
1. Yellow stars show which dashboards are favorites.

### Work with dashboard tiles

- **View tiles**: Swipe up and down to see all tiles in the dashboard.
- **Interact with tiles**: Tap any tile to open it in focus mode and explore the data.
- **Mark favorites**: Tap the star icon to add a dashboard to your favorites.
- **Share dashboards**: Tap **Invite** or the ellipsis menu (...) to invite colleagues to view your dashboard.
- **Navigate back**: Tap the arrow next to the dashboard title to return to your workspace.

### View dashboards in different orientations

**Portrait mode**: By default, tiles appear in a uniform size and stack vertically.

**Landscape mode**: Rotate your device sideways to see the full dashboard layout as it appears in the Power BI service. You can pinch to zoom and pan to navigate different areas.

> [!TIP]
> If you own a dashboard, you can [create a custom phone view](../../create-reports/service-create-dashboard-mobile-phone-view.md) in the Power BI service to optimize how it appears in portrait mode on mobile devices.

## Additional tips

### Create a custom phone view

If you own a dashboard, you can create a custom view optimized for phones in the Power BI service. Learn more about [creating a phone view of a dashboard](../../create-reports/service-create-dashboard-mobile-phone-view.md).

### Sync with Apple Watch

iPhone users can [sync dashboards with Apple Watch](mobile-apple-watch.md) for quick access to key metrics.
