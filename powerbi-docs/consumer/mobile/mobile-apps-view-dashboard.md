Dashboards are a portal to your company's life cycle and processes. A dashboard is an overview, a single place to monitor the current state of the business.

## Create dashboards in the Power BI service (https://powerbi.com)
**You don't create dashboards in the mobile apps.** 

To see dashboards and reports on your mobile device, you need to create or connect to them in a Web browser. 

1. Go to the Power BI service ([https://www.powerbi.com](https://www.powerbi.com)) and [sign up for an account](../../service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi.md).
2. [Create your own Power BI dashboards and report](../../service-get-started.md), or connect to existing [Power BI apps](../../service-connect-to-services.md) for a variety of services, such as [Microsoft Dynamics CRM](../../service-connect-to-microsoft-dynamics-crm.md) and [Adobe Analytics](../../service-connect-to-adobe-analytics.md).

Here's a Power BI dashboard in the Power BI service:
