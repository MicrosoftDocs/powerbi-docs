Dashboards are a portal to your company's life cycle and processes. A dashboard is an overview, a single place to monitor the current state of the business.

## Create dashboards in the Power BI service (https://powerbi.com)
**You don't create dashboards in the mobile apps.** 

To see dashboards and reports on your mobile device, you need to create or connect to them in a Web browser. 

1. Go to the Power BI service ([https://www.powerbi.com](https://www.powerbi.com)) and [sign up for an account](../../fundamentals/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi.md).
2. [Create your own Power BI dashboards and report](../../fundamentals/service-get-started.md), or connect to existing [Power BI apps](../../connect-data/service-connect-to-services.md) for a variety of services, such as [Microsoft Dynamics CRM](../../connect-data/service-connect-to-services.md).

Here's a Power BI dashboard in the Power BI service:

## View dashboards on your iPhone

2. Tap a dashboard to open it.  
   
    ![Tap dashboard](./media/mobile-apps-view-dashboard/power-bi-iphone-dashboard-home.png)
   
   * The yellow stars ![Favorite star](././././media/mobile-apps-view-dashboard/power-bi-mobile-yes-favorite-icon.png) show which dashboards are favorites.
   
   By default, Power BI dashboards look a little different on your iPhone. All the tiles appear the same size, and they're arranged one after another from top to bottom.
