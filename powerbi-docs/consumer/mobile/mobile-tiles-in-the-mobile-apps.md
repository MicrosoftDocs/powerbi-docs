Tiles are live snapshots of your data, pinned to a dashboard. Their values change as the data changes. **You [add tiles to a dashboard in the Power BI service](../end-user-tiles.md).** 

Then in the Power BI mobile apps, you open tiles in focus mode and interact with them. You can open tiles with all kinds of visuals, including tiles based on Bing and R.

> [!NOTE]
> Report tiles don't have a focus mode and aren't interactive when viewed in the Power BI mobile apps.

## Tiles in the iOS apps

1. Open a [dashboard in the mobile app for iOS](mobile-apps-view-dashboard.md).
2. Tap a tile. It opens in focus mode, where it's easier to view and explore the tile data. In focus mode you can:
   
   In a line, bar, or column chart, tap to view the values for specific parts of the visualization.

   *For example, in this line chart, the selected values are for **This Year Sales** and **Last Year Sales** in **August**.*  
   
   In a pie chart, tap a slice of the pie to show the value of the slice at the top of the pie.

3. In a map, tap the **Center Map** icon ![Center map icon](media/mobile-tiles-in-the-mobile-apps/power-bi-center-map-icon.png) to center the map to your current location.

4. Tap the pencil icon ![Pencil icon](./media/mobile-tiles-in-the-mobile-apps/power-bi-iphone-annotate-icon.png) to [annotate a tile](mobile-annotate-and-share-a-tile-from-the-mobile-apps.md#annotate-and-share-the-tile-report-or-visual) and then the share icon ![Share icon](./media/mobile-tiles-in-the-mobile-apps/power-bi-iphone-share-icon.png) to [share it with others](mobile-annotate-and-share-a-tile-from-the-mobile-apps.md#annotate-and-share-the-tile-report-or-visual).

5. [Add an alert to the tile](mobile-set-data-alerts-in-the-mobile-apps.md). If the values go above or below targets, Power BI will notify you.

6. Sometimes the dashboard creator has added a link to a tile. If so, it has a link icon ![Link icon](media/mobile-tiles-in-the-mobile-apps/power-bi-iphone-link-icon.png) when it's in focus mode:
   
    ![Screenshot of a dashboard, showing the link icon in focus mode.](media/mobile-tiles-in-the-mobile-apps/power-bi-iphone-tile-link.png)
   
    Links can go to other Power BI dashboards or to an external URL. You can [tap the link](../../create-reports/service-dashboard-edit-tile.md#hyperlink) to open it inside the Power BI app. If it's an external site, Power BI asks you to allow it.
   
    ![Screenshot of a dialog, showing to allow Power B I to open links with internal browser.](media/mobile-tiles-in-the-mobile-apps/pbi_andr_openlinkmessage.png)
   
    After you open the link in the Power BI app, you can copy the link and open it in a browser window instead.
7. [Open the report](mobile-reports-in-the-mobile-apps.md) ![Open report icon in i O S.](././media/mobile-tiles-in-the-mobile-apps/power-bi-ipad-open-report-icon.png) that the tile is based on.
8. To leave tile focus mode, tap the tile name, then tap the dashboard name or **My Workspace**.

   * Tap the Pencil icon ![Pencil icon](./media/mobile-tiles-in-the-mobile-apps/power-bi-iphone-annotate-icon.png) to [annotate a tile](mobile-annotate-and-share-a-tile-from-the-mobile-apps.md#annotate-and-share-the-tile-report-or-visual) and then the Share snapshot icon ![Share snapshot icon](./media/mobile-tiles-in-the-mobile-apps/pbi_andr_sharesnapicon.png) to [share it](mobile-annotate-and-share-a-tile-from-the-mobile-apps.md#annotate-and-share-the-tile-report-or-visual) with others.

    ![Screenshot of a dashboard, showing the vertical ellipsis pointing to Open Link.](media/mobile-tiles-in-the-mobile-apps/power-bi-android-tile-link.png)
