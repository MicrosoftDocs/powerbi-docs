# Get started with the Power BI mobile app on Android devices

The Android app for Microsoft Power BI delivers the mobile BI experience for Power BI, Power BI Report Server, and Reporting Services. View and interact with your company dashboards on premises and in the cloud from anywhere, with live, touch-enabled mobile access. Explore the data in dashboards, and share with your colleagues in email or text messages.

You create Power BI reports in Power BI Desktop, and publish them:

* [Publish them to the Power BI service](../../fundamentals/power-bi-overview.md), and create dashboards.
* [Publish them on premises to Power BI Report Server](../../report-server/quickstart-create-powerbi-report.md).

Then in the Power BI app for Android, you interact with your dashboards and reports, whether on premises or in the cloud.

## Prerequisites

### Get the app

[Download the Power BI for Android app](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=544867) from Google Play.
  
Power BI can run on a number of different Android devices. Make sure your device meets the following requirements:

* It runs the Android 11.0 operating system or later. To check on your device, go to **Settings** > **About device** > **Android version**.
* It has Android System Webview version 94.0.4606.50 or later (or a comparable version) installed.

**Start when you open the app**
Even without signing up or signing in, after you open the app you can flip through the sign-in pages for a quick overview of things you can do with the Power BI app on your Android device. Tap **I'll sign in later** to view and explore the samples, and get hands-on experience with the app. You can [go back to the samples](mobile-android-app-get-started.md#try-the-power-bi-and-reporting-services-samples) whenever you want from the dashboards home page.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all features are available in the samples. For example, you can't view the sample reports that underlie the dashboards, you can't share the samples with others, and you can't make them your favorites.

## Find your content in the Power BI mobile apps

Tap the magnifying glass in the header to start searching for your Power BI content.

## View your favorite dashboards and reports

Tap **Favorites** (:::image type="icon" source="./media/mobile-android-app-get-started/power-bi-mobile-apps-home-favorites-icon.png" border="false":::) on the navigation bar to view your Favorites page.

## Enterprise support for the Power BI mobile apps

Organizations can use Microsoft Intune to manage devices and applications, including the Power BI mobile apps for Android and iOS.

By using Microsoft Intune, organizations can control items like requiring an access pin, controlling how the application handles data, and even encrypting application data when the app isn't in use.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use the Power BI mobile app on your Android device and your organization configures Microsoft Intune MAM, then background data refresh is turned off. The next time you enter the app, Power BI refreshes the data from the Power BI service on the web.

For more information, see [configuring Power BI mobile apps with Microsoft Intune](../../enterprise/service-admin-mobile-intune.md).
