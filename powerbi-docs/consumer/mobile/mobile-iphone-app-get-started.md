# Get started with the Power BI mobile app on iOS devices
The Microsoft Power BI for iOS app on the iPhone and iPad delivers the mobile BI experience for Power BI, Power BI Report Server, and Reporting Services. View and interact with your company dashboards on premises and in the cloud from anywhere, with live, touch-enabled mobile access. Explore the data in dashboards, and share with your colleagues in email or text messages. And keep up to date with your most timely data on your [Apple Watch](mobile-apple-watch.md).  

![Power BI mobile app on iPhone or iPad](./media/mobile-iphone-app-get-started/pbi_ipad_iphonedevices.png)

You create Power BI reports in Power BI Desktop, and publish them:

* [Publish them to the Power BI service](../../service-get-started.md), and create dashboards.
* [Publish them on premises to Power BI Report Server](../../report-server/quickstart-create-powerbi-report.md).

Then in the Power BI mobile app for iOS, you interact with your dashboards and reports, whether on premises or in the cloud.

## Download the app
[Download the iOS app](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=522062 "Download the iOS app")  from the Apple App Store to your iPhone or iPad.

You can run the Power BI for iOS app on any device running iOS 11 or later. 

## Sign up for the Power BI service
If you haven't already signed up, go to [powerbi.com](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/get-started/), and under **Power BI - Cloud collaboration and sharing**, select **Try free**.


## Get started with the Power BI app
1. In your iOS device, open the Power BI app.
2. To view your Power BI dashboards, tap **Power BI**.  
   To view your Reporting Services mobile reports and KPIs, tap **Report Server**.
   
   ![Sign in to the Power BI mobile app](./media/mobile-iphone-app-get-started/power-bi-connect-to-login.png)
   
   When you're in the app, just tap the account profile image in the upper left corner of your screen to switch between the two. 

## Try the Power BI and Reporting Services samples
Even without signing up, you can view and interact with the Power BI and Reporting Services samples.

To access the samples, tap **More options** (...) on the navigation bar and choose **Samples**.

A number of Power BI samples are followed by several Report server samples.

   ![Power BI mobile samples](./media/mobile-iphone-app-get-started/power-bi-iphone-powerbi-samples.png)
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > Not all features are available in the samples. For example, you can't view the sample reports that underlie the dashboards, you can't share the samples with others, and you can't make them your favorites. 
   >

## Find your content in the Power BI mobile apps

Tap the magnifying glass in the header to start searching for your Power BI content.

## View your favorite dashboards and reports
Tap **Favorites** (![](./media/mobile-iphone-app-get-started/power-bi-mobile-apps-home-favorites-icon.png)) on the navigation bar to view your Favorites page.

## Enterprise support for the Power BI mobile apps
Organizations can use Microsoft Intune to manage devices and applications, including the Power BI mobile apps for Android and iOS.

Microsoft Intune lets organizations control items like requiring an access pin, controlling how data is handled by the application, and even encrypting application data when the app isn't in use.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use the Power BI mobile app on your iOS device and your organization has configured Microsoft Intune MAM, then background data refresh is turned off. The next time you enter the app, Power BI refreshes the data from the Power BI service on the web.
> 

Read more about [configuring Power BI mobile apps with Microsoft Intune](../../service-admin-mobile-intune.md).
