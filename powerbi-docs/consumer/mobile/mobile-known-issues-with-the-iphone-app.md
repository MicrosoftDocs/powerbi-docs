## "We encountered communication failures"

"We encountered communication failures. The failures might be related to proxy settings on your Wi-Fi connection. Switching to a different Wi-Fi connection may resolve the issue."

You might see this message if your iPhone or iPad internet connection requires a mandatory explicit HTTP proxy configured, either manually or automatically. In this case, the Power BI app won't work on your iOS device.

### Workaround

Switch the iPhone or iPad to another connection that doesn't require an explicit HTTP proxy setting, that is, one configured as HTTP Proxy is Off.
