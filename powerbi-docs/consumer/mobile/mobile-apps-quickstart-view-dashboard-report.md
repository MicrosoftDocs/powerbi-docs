A dashboard is a portal to your company's life cycle and processes. It is an overview, a single place to monitor the current state of the business. Reports are interactive views of your data, with visuals representing different findings and insights from that data.

## Prerequisites

* **Sign up for Power BI**: If you're not signed up for Power BI, [sign up for a free trial](https://app.powerbi.com/signupredirect?pbi_source=web) before you begin.
* **Install the Power BI app for your device**: Download the Power BI mobile app** from the [App store](https://apps.apple.com/app/microsoft-power-bi/id929738808) (iOS) or [Google play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.powerbim&amp;amp;clcid=0x409) (Android).
* **Download the Retail Analysis Sample**: The first step in this quickstart is to download the Retail Analysis Sample in the Power BI service. [Learn how to download a sample](./mobile-apps-download-samples.md) into your Power BI account to get started. Be sure to choose the Retail Analysis Sample.

Once you've completed the prerequisites and downloaded the Retail Analysis Sample to your Power BI account, you are ready to begin this quick tour.

## View a dashboard on your mobile device
1. On your device, open the Power BI app and sign in with your Power BI account credentials, the same ones you used in the Power BI service in the browser.
 
1. Now, tap the **Workspaces** icon ![workspaces icon](./media/mobile-apps-quickstart-view-dashboard-report/power-bi-iphone-workspaces-button.png), choose **My Workspaces**, and then tap the Retail Analysis Sample to open it.

    Power BI dashboards look a little different on your mobile device than they do on the Power BI service. All the tiles appear the same width, and they're arranged one after another from top to bottom.

6. Scroll down and tap the "This Year's Sales, Last Year's Sales" filled line chart.

    ![Tap a tile to go to focus mode](./media/mobile-apps-quickstart-view-dashboard-report/power-bi-android-quickstart-tap-tile-fave.png)

    It opens in focus mode.

7. In focus mode, tap **Apr** in the chart. The values for April appear at the top of the chart.

8. Tap the Report icon ![Report icon](./media/mobile-apps-quickstart-view-dashboard-report/power-bi-android-quickstart-report-icon.png) at the bottom of the screen (on Android devices this may be at the top of the screen). The report related to this tile opens in landscape mode.
