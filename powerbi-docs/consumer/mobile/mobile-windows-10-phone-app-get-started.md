# Get started with the Power BI app for Windows 10
The Power BI app for Windows 10 brings Power BI to your Windows device. You get up-to-date, touch-enabled access to your business information. You can interact with all the Power BI reports, dashboards, and apps that are available to you in the Power BI service - both those that you've [created](../../fundamentals/service-get-started.md) yourself as well as those that have been created by others and shared with you. All this from the Power BI app for Windows 10.

## First things first
* [**Get the Power BI mobile app for Windows 10**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=526478) from the Windows Store.
  
  Your device must run Windows 10. The app can run on devices with at least 3-GB RAM and 8-GB internal storage.

    The app is designed for a minimum resolution of 460x500.
