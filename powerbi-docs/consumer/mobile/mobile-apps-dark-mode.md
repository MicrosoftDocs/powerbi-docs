# Dark mode

To accommodate your individual viewing preferences, the Power BI mobile app for iOS supports both light and dark screen modes. Dark mode reduces the brightness of the screen, making it easier to see your content.

 In dark mode, all app experiences appear with a dark background. Power BI content, however, is not affected. Your reports, dashboards, and apps, are always displayed as the designers intended.
 
 By default, your Power BI mobile app uses your device's settings to determine which screen appearance to display. If your device is configured for dark mode, the app will appear in dark mode.
 
 To switch between light and dark mode, or to let device settings determine the mode, go to **Settings > Preferences** and tap on **Appearance** to choose your desired mode.
