# Fixing "Need to update Android System Webview"
When signing in to the Android mobile app for Microsoft Power BI, you may get a message that you need to update Android System Webview. 

Say you go to the Google Play Store and update Android System Webview, then come back and try to open the Power BI mobile app again. 

If your Android device is running Android 7 or later, you may again get the message to update Android System Webview. 

## Solution: Upgrade your version of the Chrome app
Turns out you actually need to upgrade your Chrome app. 

* Go back to Google Play Store, search for Chrome, and get the upgrade.

## Next steps
* [Download the Android app](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=544867) from the Android app store.
