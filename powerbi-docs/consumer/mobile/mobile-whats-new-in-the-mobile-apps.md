Report's filter pane is now available for landscape reports (in addition to phone report).

## November 2018

Enhanced presentation mode for Surface Hub and Windows 10 devices.  Enjoy an enhanced Surface Hub meeting room experience, with improved presentation and collaboration tools, and a chromeless, large-screen optimized view, so you can focus on your data. Presentation mode also provides tools such inking to help you effectively present and have discussions about your data. Read more about presentation mode [here](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/presentation-mode-in-power-bi-windows-app/).

### Portrait report layout in tablets (iOS and Android)

We now use phone report layout, when it exists, for displaying reports on tablet in portrait mode orientation. Read more on [how to create phone layout in Power BI Service or Desktop](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/desktop-create-phone-report/).

### Supporting report query string

### Shared credentials (now in Android)

Signing in to Power BI from your mobile app has never been easier. With shared credentials, we simplified the sign-in process by using other Office 365 app credentials on the device to authenticate you in the Power BI service.

### In-app URLs (now in Android) 

Links in reports that point to other Power BI artifacts now open directly inside the app. This enables you to build custom navigation flows, for example, linking from a report into a dashboard.

### Show data and copy values

Report visual action menu (...) now has the option to show the underlying data in table format. Once in the table, you can long-tap to select and copy values from that table (assuming that there is no Intune policy restricting copying).

## October 2018

## September 2018

### Phone report editing in the browser (all devices)

Now you can create a phone report layout for a report that is already published in the Power BI service, and not just in Power BI Desktop. You create it in Edit mode in your browser.

### Dashboard commenting (iOS and Android) 

You can add comments directly to dashboards and specific tiles to discuss your data, and anyone viewing the dashboard will see your comments. You can also pull others in your organization into the conversation by @mentioning them. Those you’ve @mentioned receive a push notification with your message to their mobile phone.

Currently available for iOS and Android devices. Windows support coming soon.

Read the Power BI [blog post about dashboard comments](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/announcing-dashboard-comments-in-power-bi/).
