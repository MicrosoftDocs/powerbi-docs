## August 2020
### We've improved how you navigate to your content (iOS and Android)
Now you can get around your content quickly and easily with a **new navigation tree**, available from the header drop down in reports, dashboards, and apps. You see the location hierarchy of your content at a glance, and you can easily navigate up the content hierarchy, go to sibling content, or even get quickly back to your home page. If the item you’re viewing is part of an app, the tree displays the entire contents of the app--sections, links, and all reports and dashboards. If the item you’re viewing is a report, you’ll also find a list of all visible report pages. It's never been so easy to get from one page to another! Check it out!

### Dashboards now support full-screen mode (iOS and Android)
Now you can view your dashboards in full-screen mode, giving you more space to view your dashboard content. 

## March 2020

### Use shortcuts and Google Search to launch your content (Android)

And use Google Search to quickly search for and open your Power BI content. Learn more about [Android app shortcuts](mobile-app-quick-access-shortcuts.md) and [Google Search](mobile-app-find-access-google-search.md)!

### Enhanced security using device protection (preview) (Android)
Use your device's built-in protection capabilities to secure your Power BI app and get the privacy you need. Requiring biometric authentication (Fingerprint ID) for accessing the Power BI app ensures your data is kept private and seen by your eyes only. [Learn about native secure access](mobile-native-secure-access.md)

## February 2020

### Multi-select mode (Android and iOS)

We've added the capability to select multiple data points on a report page. When multi-select is turned on, each data point you tap gets added to the other selected data points, with the combined results automatically highlighted in all the visuals on the page. To turn on multi-select mode, go to the [mobile app settings](./mobile-app-interaction-settings.md) page.

>[!NOTE]
>Multi-select mode will be supported on Power BI Report Server in the next Report Server release.

### Report footer can now always be visible in the mobile app for iPhones

On your iPhone, like on your Android phone, you can now decide to dock the report footer at the bottom of the report page, where it is always visible and available, regardless of your actions on the page. This makes it easy to use all the options it provides. To dock the footer, toggle the **Docked report footer** switch on the [mobile app settings](./mobile-app-interaction-settings.md) page.

## December 2019

### Docked report footer and a refresh button - new experiences for interacting with reports (Android)

We've heard from our Android users that their experience using reports is not optimal - that it is hard to use the report footer and that pull-to-refresh is too sensitive in some devices. Therefore, in this release, we've changed these behaviors:
* **Docked report footer** - now, when you open a report on your phone, you'll find the report footer docked at the bottom of the report page, where it's always visible and available, regardless of your actions on the page. This makes it easy to use all the options it provides.
* **Refresh button on report header** - you'll also find a refresh button in the report header, making it easy to refresh the report exactly when you intend to.

Those users who prefer the previous behavior can restore these behaviors with the mobile app's new, expanded [interaction settings](./mobile-app-interaction-settings.md).

In addition, IT admins can [remotely override the new default settings](./mobile-app-configuration.md#interaction-settings-ios-and-android) on behalf of their users, using their MDM tool of choice with an app configuration file. In this way all users in an organization can have the same behavior configured for them.

> [!NOTE]
> Interaction settings for the refresh button and for docking the report footer do not currently have an effect on Report Server reports. This will change with the January Report Server release!

### Set default bookmarks from your mobile app
Now you can set default bookmarks for your reports directly from your Power BI mobile app. Then, every time you open a report, its default bookmark will be applied automatically. [Learn more!](./mobile-reports-in-the-mobile-apps.md#bookmarks)

### Filtering by location on Android tablets
Geo-filtering lets you filter your reports based on your current location. This feature is now also available in the Power BI app for Android tablets. [Learn more!](./mobile-apps-geographic-filtering.md)

## November 2019

### Power BI app's new look is now on by default
 
Now when you open the app, the new look and navigation bars are automatically turned on, simplifying the way you find and open content. Use the app's [home page](mobile-apps-home-page.md) as your starting point - you'll get quick access to your most important content, as well as an [activity feed](mobile-apps-home-page.md#activity-feed) that keeps you up-to-date with all your latest alerts, notifications, and more.

### See all your latest Power BI activity
 
The activity feed helps you keep track of what's happening with your Power BI content, in real-time. Simply go to the app's home page and open the Activity tab to view all your latest notifications, alerts, comments, @mentions, and more. [Learn more](mobile-apps-home-page.md#activity-feed).

### Use bookmarks in your reports

## October 2019

### Android support for remote configuration of Report Server access settings

We added Android support for remote configuration of the Power BI mobile app's Report Server access settings.

### Cross-report drillthrough

This month we've added support for cross-report drillthrough. You can now tap on a data point to drill through to access other reports and report pages. When you drill through to a target page, the content in that page is filtered based on the drillthrough settings.

> [!NOTE]
> Cross-report drillthrough is only available if it was enabled during report creation. [Learn more about cross-report drillthrough](../../create-reports/desktop-cross-report-drill-through.md).


### Data sensitivity labels

You can now see sensitivity labels that content owners have set on reports, dashboards, datasets, and dataflows to classify the sensitivity of their data. Sensitivity labels determine how content can be shared with other users. [Learn more about data sensitivity labels in Power BI](../../admin/service-security-data-protection-overview.md).

### Single tap report interaction - GA

Single tap is now GA, and will become the default touch interaction for new users. Users will still be able to turn it off and have double tap in the app settings.

### Enhanced conditional access protection (iOS, Android)

We integrated with Azure AD [new app protection-based conditional access capability](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/app-protection-based-conditional-access) to increase security by limiting access to Power BI before app policy is applied.

### Device protection (iOS)

Users can use device built-in protection to secure Power BI, by asking for Face ID, Touch ID or passcode for accessing Power BI. This can be control by the user using the app settings, but also by admins using Intune and any other MDM tool. [Learn more](./mobile-native-secure-access.md).

![Single tap interaction](./media/mobile-whats-new-in-the-mobile-apps/single-tap-2.gif)
