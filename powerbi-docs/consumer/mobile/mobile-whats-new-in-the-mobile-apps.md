**Access cached data** Cached data no longer expires, so you have access to your cached data indefinitely while offline.

**R tiles and web widgets** View these new tile types in dashboards on your mobile device.

**Bing dashboards** In the Power BI service, you can now create [dashboards with Bing search results](../../service-connect-to-services.md), and view them on your mobile device.
