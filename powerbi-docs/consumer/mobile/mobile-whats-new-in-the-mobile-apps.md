## May 2020
### We've added dark mode to Power BI mobile (iOS)
Try out the new dark mode in the Power BI mobile app for iOS13. In dark mode, you'll see light text on a dark background, reducing the brightness of the screen and making it easier to see your content. You can switch between themes in the app appearance settings. [Learn more](mobile-apps-dark-mode.md)

Now, when presenting a report in presentation mode, you can apply both personal and report bookmarks to report pages, telling the story about your data. [Check it out!](mobile-windows-10-app-presentation-mode.md#use-presentation-mode)

## April 2020

### Sharing from workspaces is now available
We've added the capability to share reports and dashboards from workspaces. You can now share your content from "My workspace" and from other workspaces if the workspace owner allows it, just like in the Power BI service. 

### Dashboards now support full-screen mode (iOS and Android)
Now you can view your dashboards in full-screen mode, giving you more space to view your dashboard content. 

## March 2020

### Use shortcuts and Google Search to launch your content (Android)
We've made it easier to find and launch your data by integrating both shortcuts and Google Search with the Power BI app. Create shortcuts for easy access to your favorite reports and dashboards directly from your device's home screen. And use Google Search to quickly search for and open your Power BI content. Learn more about [Android app shortcuts](mobile-app-quick-access-shortcuts.md) and [Google Search](mobile-app-find-access-google-search.md)!

### Enhanced security using device protection (preview) (Android)
Use your device's built-in protection capabilities to secure your Power BI app and get the privacy you need. Requiring biometric authentication (Fingerprint ID) for accessing the Power BI app ensures your data is kept private and seen by your eyes only. [Learn about native secure access](mobile-native-secure-access.md)

### Scanning is now available on iPad
Now, right from your iPad, you can scan barcodes to filter your reports, and use QR codes to open reports quickly.  

### Updated filtering experience
Filters in the Power BI app have new functionality and a new design. This includes improved visibility of applied filters affecting report visuals, and the ability to lock and even hide filters. These changes also provide better compatibility with filtering in the Power BI service.

## February 2020

### Multi-select mode (Android and iOS)

We've added the capability to select multiple data points on a report page. When multi-select is turned on, each data point you tap gets added to the other selected data points, with the combined results automatically highlighted in all the visuals on the page. To turn on multi-select mode, go to the [mobile app settings](./mobile-app-interaction-settings.md) page.

>[!NOTE]
>Multi-select mode will be supported on Power BI Report Server in the next Report Server release.

### Report footer can now always be visible in the mobile app for iPhones

On your iPhone, like on your Android phone, you can now decide to dock the report footer at the bottom of the report page, where it is always visible and available, regardless of your actions on the page. This makes it easy to use all the options it provides. To dock the footer, toggle the **Docked report footer** switch on the [mobile app settings](./mobile-app-interaction-settings.md) page.

### Support for PBIRS reports (preview) (Windows)

You can now open your Power BI Report Server (PBIRS) reports in the Power BI app.

Annotations you create during presentations become an integral part of the presentation and a key component of the discussion. Now, when you annotate reports in presentation mode, you can share a snapshot of the report page with your colleagues. [Learn more](./mobile-windows-10-app-presentation-mode.md#use-presentation-mode)

## December 2019

### Docked report footer and a refresh button - new experiences for interacting with reports (Android)

We've heard from our Android users that their experience using reports is not optimal - that it is hard to use the report footer and that pull-to-refresh is too sensitive in some devices. Therefore, in this release, we've changed these behaviors:
* **Docked report footer** - now, when you open a report on your phone, you'll find the report footer docked at the bottom of the report page, where it's always visible and available, regardless of your actions on the page. This makes it easy to use all the options it provides.
* **Refresh button on report header** - you'll also find a refresh button in the report header, making it easy to refresh the report exactly when you intend to.

Those users who prefer the previous behavior can restore these behaviors with the mobile app's new, expanded [interaction settings](./mobile-app-interaction-settings.md).

In addition, IT admins can [remotely override the new default settings](./mobile-app-configuration.md#interaction-settings-ios-and-android) on behalf of their users, using their MDM tool of choice with an app configuration file. In this way all users in an organization can have the same behavior configured for them.

> [!NOTE]
> Interaction settings for the refresh button and for docking the report footer do not currently have an effect on Report Server reports. This will change with the January Report Server release!

### Set default bookmarks from your mobile app
Now you can set default bookmarks for your reports directly from your Power BI mobile app. Then, every time you open a report, its default bookmark will be applied automatically. [Learn more!](./mobile-reports-in-the-mobile-apps.md#bookmarks)

### Filtering by location on Android tablets
Geo-filtering lets you filter your reports based on your current location. This feature is now also available in the Power BI app for Android tablets. [Learn more!](./mobile-apps-geographic-filtering.md)

## November 2019

### Power BI app's new look is now on by default
 
Now when you open the app, the new look and navigation bars are automatically turned on, simplifying the way you find and open content. Use the app's [home page](mobile-apps-home-page.md) as your starting point - you'll get quick access to your most important content, as well as an [activity feed](mobile-apps-home-page.md#activity-feed) that keeps you up-to-date with all your latest alerts, notifications, and more.

### See all your latest Power BI activity
 
The activity feed helps you keep track of what's happening with your Power BI content, in real-time. Simply go to the app's home page and open the Activity tab to view all your latest notifications, alerts, comments, @mentions, and more. [Learn more](mobile-apps-home-page.md#activity-feed).

### Use bookmarks in your reports

The Power BI mobile app now supports bookmarks created in Power BI. When you open the app, you can take advantage of bookmarks created by the report author and any personal bookmarks that you yourself have created. [Learn more](mobile-reports-in-the-mobile-apps.md#bookmarks).

## October 2019

### Android support for remote configuration of Report Server access settings

We added Android support for remote configuration of the Power BI mobile app's Report Server access settings. IT admins can now use their organization's MDM tool to remotely configure those settings on both iOS and Android devices. See [Configure Power BI mobile app access to Report Server remotely](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/report-server/configure-powerbi-mobile-apps-remote) for details.

### Cross-report drillthrough

This month we've added support for cross-report drillthrough. You can now tap on a data point to drill through to access other reports and report pages. When you drill through to a target page, the content in that page is filtered based on the drillthrough settings.

> [!NOTE]
> Cross-report drillthrough is only available if it was enabled during report creation. [Learn more about cross-report drillthrough](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/desktop-cross-report-drill-through).


### Data sensitivity labels

You can now see sensitivity labels that content owners have set on reports, dashboards, datasets, and dataflows to classify the sensitivity of their data. Sensitivity labels determine how content can be shared with other users. [Learn more about data sensitivity labels in Power BI](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/admin/service-security-data-protection-overview).

### Single tap report interaction - GA

Single tap is now GA, and will become the default touch interaction for new users. Users will still be able to turn it off and have double tap in the app settings.

### Enhanced conditional access protection (iOS, Android)

We integrated with AAD [new app protection-based conditional access capability](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/app-protection-based-conditional-access) to increase security by limiting access to Power BI before app policy is applied.

### Device protection (iOS)
