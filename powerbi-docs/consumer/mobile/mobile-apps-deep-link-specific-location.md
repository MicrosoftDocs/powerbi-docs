# Create a link to a specific location in the Power BI mobile apps
You can create and use a uniform resource identifier (URI) to link to a specific location (a *deep link*) within the Power BI mobile apps on all the mobile platforms: iOS, Android devices, and Windows 10.

URI links can point directly to dashboards, tiles, and reports.

The destination of the deep link determines the format of the URI. Follow these steps to create deep links to different locations. 

## Open the Power BI mobile app
Use this URI to open the Power BI mobile app on any device:

    mspbi://app/


## Open to a specific dashboard
This URI opens the Power BI mobile app to a specific dashboard:

    mspbi://app/OpenDashboard?DashboardObjectId=<36-character-dashboard-id>

To find the 36-character dashboard object id, navigate to the specific dashboard in the Power BI service (https://powerbi.com). For example, see the highlighted section of this URL:

`https://powerbi.com/groups/me/dashboards/**61b7e871-cb98-48ed-bddc-6572c921e270**`

If the dashboard is in a group other than My Workspace, add `&GroupObjectId=<36-character-group-id>` either before or after the dashboard ID. For example, 

mspbi://app/OpenDashboard?DashboardObjectId=e684af3a-9e7f-44ee-b679-b9a1c59b5d60**&GroupObjectId=8cc900cc-7339-467f-8900-fec82d748248**

Note the ampersand (&) between the two.

## Open to a specific tile in focus
This URI opens a specific tile in focus in the Power BI mobile app:

    mspbi://app/OpenTile?DashboardObjectId=<36-character-dashboard-id>&TileObjectId=<36-character-tile-id>

To find the 36-character dashboard and tile object IDs, navigate to the specific dashboard in the Power BI service (https://powerbi.com) and open the tile in focus mode. For example, see the highlighted sections of this URL:

`https://powerbi.com/groups/me/dashboards/**3784f99f-b460-4d5e-b86c-b6d8f7ec54b7**/tiles/**565f9740-5131-4648-87f2-f79c4cf9c5f5**/infocus`

For this tile, the URI would be:

    mspbi://app/OpenTile?DashboardObjectId=3784f99f-b460-4d5e-b86c-b6d8f7ec54b7&TileObjectId=565f9740-5131-4648-87f2-f79c4cf9c5f5

Note the ampersand (&) between the two.

If the dashboard is in a group other than My Workspace, add `&GroupObjectId=<36-character-group-id>`

## Open to a specific report
This URI opens a specific report in the Power BI mobile app:

    mspbi://app/OpenReport?ReportObjectId=<36-character-report-id>

To find the 36-character report object id, navigate to the specific report in the Power BI service (https://powerbi.com). For example, see the highlighted section of this URL:

`https://powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/df9f0e94-31df-450b-b97f-4461a7e4d300`

If the report is in a group other than My Workspace, add `&GroupObjectId=<36-character-group-id>` either before or after the report ID. For example, 

mspbi://app/OpenReport?ReportObjectId=e684af3a-9e7f-44ee-b679-b9a1c59b5d60**&GroupObjectId=8cc900cc-7339-467f-8900-fec82d748248**

Note the ampersand (&) between the two.

## Open to a specific report page
This URI opens a specific report page in the Power BI mobile app:

    mspbi://app/OpenReport?ReportObjectId=<36-character-report-id>&reportPage=ReportSection<number>

The report page is called "ReportSection" followed by a number. Again, open the report in the Power BI service (https://powerbi.com) and navigate to the specific report page. 

For example, see the highlighted section of this URL:

`https://powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/df9f0e94-31df-450b-b97f-4461a7e4d300/ReportSection11`

## Open in full-screen mode
Add the parameter in bold to open to a specific report in full-screen mode:

    mspbi://app/OpenReport?ReportObjectId=<36-character-report-id>**&openFullScreen=true**

For example: 

mspbi://app/OpenReport?ReportObjectId=500217de-50f0-4af1-b345-b81027224033&openFullScreen=true

## Add context (optional)
You can also add context in the string. Then if you need to contact us, we can use that context to filter our data to your app. Add `&context=<app-name>` to the link

For example, see the highlighted section of this URL: 

`https://powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/df9f0e94-31df-450b-b97f-4461a7e4d300/&context=SlackDeepLink`
