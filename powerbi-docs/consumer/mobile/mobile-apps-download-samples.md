# Download samples to My workspace in the Power BI service

Some of the Mobile app documentation available here uses sample data for the purposes of illustration. To follow along on your device, you can download the sample data to your Power BI service account. You can then view the sample data from the Power BI Mobile app on your device. This article describes how to download the sample data to your Power BI service account. 

## Prerequisites

You must have a Power BI service account to be able to download data. If you're not yet signed up for Power BI, [sign up for a free trial](https://app.powerbi.com/signupredirect?pbi_source=web) before you begin.

## Download a sample

1. Open the Power BI service (`app.powerbi.com`), and select **Learn** in the navigation pane.

1. On the **Learning center** page, under **Sample reports**, scroll left and right to view the samples.

1. Select a sample to download. It opens in Reading mode.

   > [!Note]
   > Be sure to choose the sample that's described in the tutorial, quickstart, or article that you're using. 
   
Power BI imports the sample, and adds a new dashboard, report, and semantic model to **My workspace**.
