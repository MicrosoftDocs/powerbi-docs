Copilot in Power BI mobile apps brings AI-powered insights directly to your mobile device, helping you make data-driven decisions on the go. Whether you're reviewing a specific report or exploring data across your organization, Copilot provides intelligent assistance through natural language interactions, delivering instant summaries, answers, and visualizations.

The Power BI mobile apps offer two distinct Copilot experiences, each designed for different scenarios: a [standalone Copilot](#standalone-copilot-preview) experience and an [in-report Copilot](#in-report-copilot-preview) experience.

## Copilot features in Power BI mobile apps

### Standalone Copilot (preview)

The standalone Copilot provides a full-screen chat experience that you can access from the app's home page. It can query any report, semantic model, or data agent in your organization without needing to open a specific item first.

**Key capabilities:**

- Ask questions about any accessible data in your organization
- Query reports, semantic models, and data agents from one place
- Get answers with both textual summaries and interactive visuals
- Use voice input to dictate questions (iPhone and iPad only)
- Share Copilot responses and visuals with colleagues

**Best for:** Exploring data across multiple sources or when you don't know which specific report to open.

### In-report Copilot (preview)

The in-report Copilot provides context-aware assistance for the report you're currently viewing. Access it by tapping the Copilot icon in any open report header.

**Key capabilities:**

- Generate AI-powered summaries of report data
- Get insights about the current report's content

**Best for:** Quick insights and summaries when you're already viewing a specific report.

## Choose the right Copilot experience

| Scenario | Use this Copilot |
|----------|------------------|
| I'm viewing a report and want a quick summary | In-report Copilot |

| I have a question but don't know which report to open | Standalone Copilot |

## Data preparation

**Data needs to be prepared to work with Copilot.** Model owners need to invest in prepping their data for AI to ensure Copilot understands the unique business context, prioritizes the right information, and delivers responses that are consistent, reliable, and aligned with your goals. Without this prep, Copilot can struggle to interpret data correctly - leading to generic, inaccurate, or even misleading outputs.
