>[!NOTE]
>Power BI mobile app support for **phones using Windows 10 Mobile** was discontinued on March 16, 2021. [Learn more](/legal/powerbi/powerbi-mobile/power-bi-mobile-app-end-of-support-for-windows-phones).

With a [Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) license](../../fundamentals/service-features-license-type.md), you can invite others to view your dashboards and reports by sharing links from the Power BI mobile apps. You can share with anyone, in or out of your organization, with or without a corporate mail account. They need to have a Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) license, or the content needs to be in a [Premium capacity](../../enterprise/service-premium-what-is.md).

From the Power BI mobile apps for iOS and Android, you can [annotate and share a snapshot of a tile, report, or visual](mobile-annotate-and-share-a-tile-from-the-mobile-apps.md) with anyone.

## Share from your iPhone or iPad

1. You can share a dashboard or report either from within the dashboard or report itself, or from the dashboard or report home page:

   * From within a dashboard or report, tap the **Share** icon :::image type="icon" source="././media/mobile-share-dashboard-from-the-mobile-apps/power-bi-android-invite-icon-ss.png" border="false"::: in the actions bar at the bottom of the dashboard or report.
   * On a dashboard or report home page, tap **Info** icon :::image type="icon" source="./media/mobile-share-dashboard-from-the-mobile-apps/power-bi-more-info-icon.png" border="false"::: next to the dashboard or report name, and then tap the **Share** icon :::image type="icon" source="./media/mobile-share-dashboard-from-the-mobile-apps/power-bi-android-invite-icon-ss.png" border="false"::: in the info tab that appears.

2. Type names, separated by commas, and a message to accompany your invitation. To allow resharing, leave **Allow recipients to reshare** selected. Resharing allows your colleagues to forward the email invitation to others in your organization, either through the web or the mobile apps.
3. Tap **Send** in the upper-right corner.

   Recipients get an email invitation with a direct link to the dashboard or report. The invitation expires after one month. When they open it in either the Power BI service or the Power BI mobile app, it's added to the **Shared with me** section of their Power BI account. To access your **Shared with me** section:

   * On the Power BI mobile app, tap **More options** (...) on the navigation bar and choose :::image type="icon" source="./././media/mobile-share-dashboard-from-the-mobile-apps/power-bi-shared-with-me-icon.png" border="false"::: **Shared with me**.
   * In the Power BI service, click :::image type="icon" source="./././media/mobile-share-dashboard-from-the-mobile-apps/power-bi-shared-with-me-icon.png" border="false"::: **Shared with me** in the left-hand navigation pane.

   For more information, see [Share Power BI reports and dashboards with coworkers and others](../../collaborate-share/service-share-dashboards.md).

### Unshare from your iPhone or iPad

You can unshare only if you're the owner of the shared content.

1. In the actions bar at the bottom of the dashboard or report, tap the **Share** icon :::image type="icon" source="././media/mobile-share-dashboard-from-the-mobile-apps/power-bi-android-invite-icon-ss.png" border="false":::.
2. Tap **Shared with**. You see the list of colleagues with whom you've shared this dashboard or report.
3. Tap **More options** (...) next to the name of the person you want to unshare, and choose whether you want to remove access just to the shared dashboard or to any underlying content it uses as well.

## Share from your Android device

1. You can share a dashboard or report either from within the dashboard or report itself, or from the dashboard or report home page:

   * From within a dashboard or report, tap **More options** (...) at the top of the dashboard or report and choose **Invite a colleague**.
   * On a dashboard or report home page, tap **More options** (...) next to the dashboard or report name, and then tap the **Share** icon :::image type="icon" source="./media/mobile-share-dashboard-from-the-mobile-apps/power-bi-android-invite-icon-ss.png" border="false"::: in the info tab that appears.

2. Type email addresses, and a message to accompany your dashboard invitation. Otherwise Power BI sends a default message. To allow resharing, leave **Allow recipients to share this dashboard** selected. Resharing allows your coworkers to forward the email invitation to others in your organization, either through the browser or the mobile apps.
3. Tap the **Send** icon :::image type="icon" source="./media/mobile-share-dashboard-from-the-mobile-apps/power-bi-android-send-icon.png" border="false"::: in the upper-right corner to send the mail.
   Recipients get an email invitation with a direct link to the dashboard or report. The invitation expires after one month. When they open it in either the Power BI service or the Power BI mobile app, it's added to the **Shared with me** section of their Power BI account. To access your **Shared with me** section:

   * On the Power BI mobile app, tap **More options** (...) on the navigation bar and choose :::image type="icon" source="./././media/mobile-share-dashboard-from-the-mobile-apps/power-bi-shared-with-me-icon.png" border="false"::: **Shared with me**.
   * In the Power BI service, click :::image type="icon" source="./././media/mobile-share-dashboard-from-the-mobile-apps/power-bi-shared-with-me-icon.png" border="false"::: **Shared with me** in the left-hand navigation pane.
