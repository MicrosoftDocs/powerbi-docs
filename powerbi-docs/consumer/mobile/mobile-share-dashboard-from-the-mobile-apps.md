With a [Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) license](../../fundamentals/service-features-license-type.md), you can invite others to view your dashboards and reports by sharing links from the Power BI mobile apps. You can share with anyone, in or out of your organization, with or without a corporate mail account. They do need to have a Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) license, too, or the content needs to be in a [Premium capacity](../../admin/service-premium-what-is.md).

From the Power BI mobile apps for iOS and Android, you can also [annotate and share a snapshot of a tile, report, or visual](mobile-annotate-and-share-a-tile-from-the-mobile-apps.md) with anyone. 

## Share from your iPhone or iPad

1. You can share a dashboard or report either from within the dashboard or report itself, or from the dashboard or report home page:
    *  From within a dashboard or report, tap the **Share** icon ![Screenshot of share icon 1.](././media/mobile-share-dashboard-from-the-mobile-apps/power-bi-android-invite-icon-ss.png) in the actions bar at the bottom of the dashboard or report.
    *  On a dashboard or report home page, tap **Info** icon ![More info](./media/mobile-share-dashboard-from-the-mobile-apps/power-bi-more-info-icon.png) next to the dashboard or report name, and then tap the **Share** icon ![Screenshot of share icon 2.](./media/mobile-share-dashboard-from-the-mobile-apps/power-bi-android-invite-icon-ss.png) in the info tab that appears.
2. Type names, separated by commas, and a message to accompany your invitation. To allow resharing, leave **Allow recipients to reshare** selected. Resharing allows your colleagues to forward the email invitation to others in your organization, either through the web or the mobile apps.
3. Tap **Send** in the upper-right corner.
   
   Recipients get an email invitation with a direct link to the dashboard or report. The invitation expires after one month. When they open it in either the Power BI service or the Power BI mobile app, it's added to the **Shared with me** section of their Power BI account. To access your Shared with me section:
   
   * On the Power BI mobile app, tap **More options** (...) on the navigation bar and choose ![Shared with me 1.](./././media/mobile-share-dashboard-from-the-mobile-apps/power-bi-shared-with-me-icon.png) **Shared with me**.
   * In the Power BI service, click ![Shared with me 2.](./././media/mobile-share-dashboard-from-the-mobile-apps/power-bi-shared-with-me-icon.png) **Shared with me** in the left-hand navigation pane.
