Share dashboards and reports from the Power BI mobile apps so colleagues can view live data on any device. Learn licensing requirements and sharing options.

In the Power BI mobile apps for iOS and Android, [annotate and share a snapshot of a tile, report, or visual](#annotate-and-share) with anyone.

Capture a snapshot of any tile, report page, or visual, add lightweight markup, and share it by email or chat.

### Steps (iOS and Android)

1. Open the tile (focus mode).
1. Tap the annotate (pen) icon. Use the toolbar to:
   - Draw (choose color and thickness)
   - Add text (choose size and color)
   - Place stamps (emoticon markers)
   - Place stamps (emoticon markers)
1. (Optional) Undo or redo changes, or clear the snapshot.
1. Tap **Share**, choose recipients, and send. The message includes the annotated image and a link to the live item. Recipients need existing permission.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Snapshot annotations are static. Data continues to update in Power BI.
