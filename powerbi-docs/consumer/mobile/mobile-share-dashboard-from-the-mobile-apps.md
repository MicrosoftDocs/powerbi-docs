With a [Power BI Pro license](../../service-features-license-type.md), you can invite others to view your dashboards and reports by sharing links from the Power BI mobile apps. You can share with anyone, in or out of your organization, with or without a corporate mail account. They do need to have a Power BI Pro license, too, or the content needs to be in a [Premium capacity](../../service-premium-what-is.md).

From the Power BI mobile apps for iOS and Android, you can also [annotate and share a snapshot of a tile, report, or visual](mobile-annotate-and-share-a-tile-from-the-mobile-apps.md) with anyone. 

## Share from your iPhone
1. In the actions bar at the bottom of the dashboard or report, tap the **Share** icon ![Share icon](././media/mobile-share-dashboard-from-the-mobile-apps/power-bi-iphone-share-dashboard-icon.png).
   
   ![iPhone Share icon](./media/mobile-share-dashboard-from-the-mobile-apps/power-bi-iphone-dashboard-invite.png)
2. Type names, separated by commas, and a message to accompany your invitation.
3. To allow resharing, leave **Allow recipients to reshare** selected.
   
   Resharing allows your colleagues to forward the email invitation to others in your organization, either through the web or the mobile apps.
5. Tap **Send** in the upper-right corner.
   
   Recipients get an email invitation with a direct link to the dashboard or report. The invitation expires after one month. When they open it, in a browser or in the Power BI mobile app, it's added to the **Shared with me** section of their Power BI account.
