# View Power BI reports optimized for your phone

Applies to:

When you view a Power BI report on your phone, Power BI checks to see if the report has been optimized for phones. If it has, Power BI automatically opens the optimized report in portrait view.

![Report in portrait mode](./media/mobile-apps-view-phone-report/07-power-bi-phone-report-portrait.png)

If a phone-optimized report doesnâ€™t exist, the report still opens, but in the non-optimized landscape views. Even in a phone-optimized report, if you turn your phone sideways, the report opens in the non-optimized view with the original report layout. If only some pages are optimized, you see a message in portrait view, indicating the report is available in landscape.

All the other features of Power BI reports still work in phone-optimized reports. Read more about what you can do in:

* [Reports on iPhones](mobile-reports-in-the-mobile-apps.md). 
* [Reports on Android phones](mobile-reports-in-the-mobile-apps.md).

## Filter the report page on a phone
If a phone-optimized report has filters defined, when you view the report on a phone you can use those filters. The report opens on your phone, filtered to the values being filtered in the report on the web. You see a message that there are active filters on the page. You can change the filters on your phone.

1. Tap the filter icon ![Phone filter icon](./media/mobile-apps-view-phone-report/power-bi-phone-filter-icon.png) at the bottom of the page. 
2. Use basic or advanced filtering to see the results you're interested in.

## Cross-highlight visuals
Cross highlighting visuals in portrait view works the way it does in the Power BI service, and on phones in landscape view: When you select data in one visual, it highlights related data in the other visuals on that page.

Read more about [filtering and highlighting in Power BI](../../power-bi-reports-filters-and-highlighting.md).

## Select visuals
In phone reports when you select a visual, the phone report highlights that visual and focuses on it, neutralizing canvas gestures.

With the visual selected, you can do things like scroll within the visual. To de-select a visual, just touch anywhere outside the visual area.

## Open visuals in focus mode
Phone reports also offer a focus mode: You get a bigger view of a single visual and explore it more easily.

* In a phone report, tap the ellipsis (**...**) in the upper-right corner of a visual  > **Expand to focus mode**.
  
    ![Expand to focus mode](././media/mobile-apps-view-phone-report/power-bi-phone-report-focus-mode.png)

What you do in focus mode carries over to the report canvas and vice versa. For example, if you highlight a value in a visual, then return to the whole report, the report is filtered to the value you highlighted in the visual.

Some actions are only possible in focus mode, due to screen size constraints:

* **Drill down** into the information displayed in a visual. Read more about [drilling down and up](mobile-apps-view-phone-report.md#drill-down-in-a-visual) in a phone report, below.
* **Sort** the values in the visual.
* **Revert**: Clear exploration steps you've taken on a visual and revert to the definition set when the report was created.
  
    To clear all exploration from a visual, tap the ellipsis (**...**) > **Revert**.
  
    ![Revert](././media/mobile-apps-view-phone-report/power-bi-phone-report-revert-levels.png)
  
    Revert is available at the report level, clearing exploration from all visuals, or at the visual level, clearing exploration from the selected visual.   

## Drill down in a visual
If hierarchy levels are defined in a visual, you can drill down into the detailed information displayed in a visual, then back up. You [add drill-down to a visual](../end-user-drill.md) either in the Power BI service or in Power BI Desktop.

There are few types of drill-down:

### Drill down on a value
1. Long tap (tap and hold) on a data point in a visual.
2. Tooltip will show up, and if hierarchy is defined, then the tooltip footer will show drill down and up arrow.
3. Tap on the down arrow for drill-down

    ![Tap drill down](././media/mobile-apps-view-phone-report/report-drill-down.png)
    
4. Tap on the up arrow for drill-up.

### Drill to next level
1. In a report on a phone, tap the ellipsis (**...**) in the upper-right corner > **Expand to focus mode**.
   
    ![Expand to focus mode](././media/mobile-apps-view-phone-report/power-bi-phone-report-focus-mode.png)
   
    In this example, the bars show the values for states.
2. Tap the explore icon ![Explore icon](./media/mobile-apps-view-phone-report/power-bi-phone-report-explore-icon.png) in the lower left.
   
    ![Explore mode](./media/mobile-apps-view-phone-report/power-bi-phone-report-explore-mode.png)
3. Tap **Show next level** or **Expand to next level**.
   
    ![Expand to next level](./media/mobile-apps-view-phone-report/power-bi-phone-report-expand-levels.png)
   
    Now the bars show the values for cities.
   
    ![Expanded levels](./media/mobile-apps-view-phone-report/power-bi-phone-report-expanded-levels.png)
4. If you tap the arrow in the upper-left corner, you return to the phone report with the values still expanded to the lower level.
   
    ![Still expanded to lower level](./media/mobile-apps-view-phone-report/power-bi-back-to-phone-report-expanded-levels.png)
5. To go back up to the original level, tap the ellipsis (**...**) again > **Revert**.
   
    ![Revert](././media/mobile-apps-view-phone-report/power-bi-phone-report-revert-levels.png)

## Drill through from a value
Drill through connects values in one report page, with other report pages. When you drill through from a data point to another report page, the data point values are used to filter the drilled through page, or it will be in the context of the selected data.
Report authors can [define drill through](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/desktop-drillthrough) when they create the report.

1. Long tap (tap and hold) on a data point in a visual.
2. Tooltip will show up, and if drill through is defined, then the tooltip footer will show drill through arrow.
3. Tap on the arrow for drill through

    ![Tap drill through](././media/mobile-apps-view-phone-report/report-drill-through1.png)

4. Choose which report page to drill through

    ![Choose report page](././media/mobile-apps-view-phone-report/report-drill-through2.png)

5. Use the back button, at the app header to go back to the page you started from.
