# View Reporting Services (SSRS) mobile reports and KPIs in the Windows 10 Power BI mobile app
The Power BI mobile app for Windows 10 offers live, touch-enabled mobile access to your important on-premises business information in SQL Server 2016 Reporting Services. 

![Reporting Services mobile reports](././media/mobile-app-windows-10-ssrs-kpis-mobile-reports/power-bi-ssrs-mobile-report.png)

## First things first
[Create Reporting Services mobile reports](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt652547.aspx) with SQL Server 2016 Enterprise Edition Mobile Report Publisher and publish them to the [Reporting Services web portal](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt637133.aspx). Create KPIs right in the web portal. Organize them in folders and mark your favorites, so you can find them easily. 

Then in the Power BI mobile app for Windows 10, view the mobile reports and KPIs, organized in folders or collected as favorites. 

> [!NOTE]
> Your device needs to be running Windows 10. The app works best on devices with at least 1 GB RAM and 8 GB internal storage.

## Create Reporting Services mobile reports and KPIs
You don't create Reporting Services KPIs and mobile reports in the Power BI mobile app. You create them in SQL Server Mobile Report Publisher and a SQL Server 2016 Reporting Services web portal.

* [Create your own Reporting Services mobile reports](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt652547.aspx), and publish them to a Reporting Services web portal.
* Create [KPIs on a Reporting Services web portal](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt683632.aspx)
