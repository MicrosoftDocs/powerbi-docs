# Tutorial: Ask questions about your data with the Q&A virtual analyst in the Power BI iOS apps

The easiest way to learn about your data is to ask questions about it in your own words. In this tutorial, you ask questions and view featured insights about sample data with the Q&A virtual analyst in the Microsoft Power BI mobile app on your iPad or iPhone.

The Q&A virtual analyst is a conversational BI experience that accesses underlying Q&A data in the [Power BI service](https://powerbi.com). It suggests data insights, and you can type or speak your own questions.
