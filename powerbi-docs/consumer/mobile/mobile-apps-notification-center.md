Notifications bring information related to your Power BI experience right to you, in the Power BI service or on your mobile device. When you open Notifications, you see a sequential feed of messages about [alerts you've set](mobile-set-data-alerts-in-the-mobile-apps.md) and new dashboards that have been shared with you.

> [!NOTE]
> On an iOS device, the first time you sign in to the [updated version of the Power BI apps](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/mobile/), you see a message asking if you'd like Power BI to send notifications. You can also configure how Power BI notifies you in **Settings** for your device.

## View notifications on your mobile device
1. When you receive notifications on your mobile device, by default Power BI makes a sound and shows a notification banner.

   You can [change how Power BI notifies you](mobile-apps-notification-center.md#change-or-turn-off-notifications-on-your-mobile-device).
2. If you've received notifications, when you sign in to Power BI on your mobile device you see a yellow dot on the notification bell icon ![notification bell](./media/mobile-apps-notification-center/powerbi-alert-tile-notification-icon.png). 

3. To see notifications in the Notification center, tap the notifications bell ![notification bell](./media/mobile-apps-notification-center/powerbi-alert-tile-notification-icon.png).
   
    Notifications are displayed with the most recent on top and unread messages highlighted. Notifications are retained for 90 days unless you delete them or reach the maximum limit of 100.
