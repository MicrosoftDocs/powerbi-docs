# Opt in for Power BI service preview features
## What are *preview features*?
As we make improvements to the Power BI service, we'll release some new functionality as *preview features*. Preview features can be turned on and off, giving you the opportunity to try them out.

Some preview features can be toggled on and off from your Power BI dashboard, Home, or report itself.

While other preview features are made available from your *Settings* menu. This article shows you how to access preview features via the Settings menu.

## Find previews and turn them on (and off)
1. Open your Settings menu by selecting the gear icon in the upper-right corner of your Power BI screen and choosing **Settings**.
   
   ![Settings menu](./media/end-user-preview-features/power-bi-settings.png).
2. Select the **General** tab. If previews exist, you'll either see an option for **Preview features** or you'll see a preview feature listed on the left.  In this example, there is a preview listed for ArcGIS Maps.

3. Select the **On** radio button, or mark the checkbox, to try out the new experience. Then select **Apply**.
4. To turn off preview features, follow steps 1-3 above, and in step 3, choose **Off**, or remove the checkmark, and select **Apply**.
