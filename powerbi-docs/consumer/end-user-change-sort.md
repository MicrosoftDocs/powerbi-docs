# Change how a chart is sorted in a Power BI report

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-service-new-look-include](../includes/power-bi-service-new-look-include.md)]

In the Power BI service, you can change how a visual looks by sorting it by different data fields. By changing how you sort a visual, you can highlight the information you want to convey, and ensure the visual reflects that trend (or emphasis).

Whether you're using numeric data (such as sales figures) or text data (such as state names), you can sort your visualizations as desired, and make them look like you want them to. Power BI provides lots of flexibility for sorting, and quick menus for you to use. On any visual, select **More actions** (...) and then select the field by which you want to sort.

Visuals on a dashboard cannot be sorted, but in a Power BI report, you can sort most visualizations alphabetically by the names of the categories in the chart, or by the numeric
values of each category. For example, this chart is sorted alphabetically by the category **store name**.

It's easy to change the sort from a category (store name) to a value (sales per square feet) instead.

1. Select **More actions** (...) and choose **Sort by > Sales Per Sq Ft**.
2. If necessary, select **More actions** (...) again and choose **Sort descending**. The field that is being used to sort is in bold and has a yellow bar.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all visuals can be sorted. For example, the following visuals cannot be sorted: treemap, map, filled map, scatter, gauge, card, waterfall.

## Saving changes you make to sort order
Power BI reports retain the filters, slicers, sorting, and other data view changes that you make. So if you navigate away from a report, and return later, your changes are saved.  If you want to revert your changes back to the report designer's settings, select **Reset to default** from the upper menu bar.

If however, the **Reset to default** button is greyed out, that means the report designer has disabled the ability to save (persist) your changes.

## Sorting using other criteria
Sometimes, you want to sort your visual using a different field (that isn't included in the visual) or other criteria.  For example, you might want
to sort by month (and not in alphabetical order) or you might
want to sort by entire numbers instead of by digit (example, 0, 1, 9, 20 and not 0, 1, 20, 9).  The report designer will be able to update the dataset to enable this type of sorting. Contact information for the designer can be found by selecting the report name from the header bar.
