# Export reports from Power BI to PDF

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-yyn](../includes/applies-yes-desktop-yes-service.md)]


With Power BI, you can publish your report to PDF format and easily create a document based on your Power BI report. When you export to PDF, each page in the Power BI report becomes an individual page in your PDF document. Exporting to PDF is one way to share or print reports.


## Export your Power BI report to PDF
In the Power BI service or Desktop, select a report to display it on the canvas. In the Power BI service, you can select a report from your **Home** page, **Apps**, or any other container from the nav pane.  

# [Power BI Desktop](#tab/powerbi-desktop)

## Export to PDF from Power BI Desktop
The process for exporting a report from Power BI Desktop to PDF is similar to the Power BI service process described earlier.  There are only a few differences:

* In Desktop, select **File** > **Export** > **Export to PDF**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/end-user-pdf/export-to-pdf-01.png" alt-text="Export to PDF from Desktop.":::

* Report pages that are currently not visible, such as any tooltips or hidden pages, aren't exported to the PDF file. 

* While the export is being processed, a dialog appears that lets you know that the export process is underway. The dialog remains on the screen until the export process completes. During the export process, all interaction with the report being exported is disabled. The only way to interact with the report is to wait until the export process completes, or to cancel the export.

* The exported PDF displays in your browser and is automatically saved in your **Downloads** folder.

## Export to PDF from the Power BI service

1. In the Power BI service, select **Export** > **PDF** from the menu bar.

    ![Select Export from the menu bar](media/end-user-pdf/power-bi-export-pdfs.png)

    A pop-up appears where you can select **Current values** or **Default values**. **Current values** exports the report in the current state, which includes the active changes you made to slicer and filter values. Most users select this option. Alternatively, selecting **Default values** exports the report in its original state, as the *designer* shared it, and doesn't reflect any changes you've made to that original state.
    
    Additionally, there's a check box to select whether or not to export the hidden tabs of a report. Select this check box if you want to export only report tabs that are visible to you in your browser. If you prefer to get all the hidden tabs as part of your export, you can leave this check box cleared. If the check box is grayed out, there are no hidden tabs in the report. After you make your selections, select **Export** to continue.
    
    You may also choose to export only the current page you're viewing in a report by checking the **Only export current page** option.  By default, this option is unchecked and all pages will be exported from your report.
    
    A progress bar displays in the upper-right corner. Exporting might take a few minutes. You can continue to work in the Power BI service while the report is being exported.

    After the Power BI service finishes the export process, the notification banner changes to let you know. In Microsoft Edge, you'll be prompted to save or open the PDF. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/end-user-pdf/power-bi-export.png" alt-text="Select to open or save the PDF.":::


    In Google Chrome, the file options display in the lower left corner of the browser. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/end-user-pdf/power-bi-export-done.png" alt-text="Lower left corner of Chrome browser showing PDF options":::

    If you make no selection, by default, the PDF is saved in your **Downloads** folder.

## Considerations and limitations
There are a few considerations and limitations to keep in mind when you work with the **Export to PDF** feature.

* R, Python, Power Apps, Power Automate, Visio, [ESRI ArcGIS](../visuals/power-bi-visualizations-arcgis.md), and paginated report visuals aren't currently supported. In the PDF, these visuals are blank and display an error message. 
* Power BI visuals that have been certified are supported in most cases. For more information on certified Power BI visuals, including how to get a Power BI visual certified, see [Get a Power BI visual certified](../developer/visuals/power-bi-custom-visuals-certified.md). Power BI visuals that haven't been certified aren't supported. In the PDF, they display with an error message.
* Power BI reports with more than 50 report pages currently can't be exported. Paginated reports don't have this limitation. See [Print a paginated report](end-user-paginated-report.md#interact-with-a-paginated-report) for details. 
* Reports larger than 500 MB currently can't be exported. 
* The process of exporting the report to PDF might take a few minutes to complete, so be patient. Factors that can affect the time required include the structure of the report and the current load on the Power BI service or Power BI Desktop.
* If the **Export to PDF** menu item isn't available in the Power BI service, it's likely because your Power BI administrator disabled the feature. Contact your administrator for details. Administrators: See [Export reports as PowerPoint presentations or PDF documents](../admin/service-admin-portal-export-sharing.md#export-reports-as-powerpoint-presentations-or-pdf-documents).
* Reports that are owned by a user outside your Power BI tenant domain, such as a report owned by someone outside your organization and shared with you, can't be published to PDF.
* You can share a dashboard with someone outside of your organization--someone who isn't in your Power BI tenant. However, that user can't export the shared dashboard's associated reports to PDF. For example, if you're aaron@contoso.com, you can share with cassie@northwinds.com. But cassie@northwinds.com can't export the associated reports to PDF.
* Background images are cropped with the visualization's bounding area. Also, when you export to PDF with reports that contain a background image, you might see a distorted image in the export if you use the **Normal** or **Fill** options for the **Page Background**. For best results, use the **Fit** option to avoid issues with your exported document. Or, remove backgrounds before exporting.
* The Power BI service uses your Power BI language setting as the language for the PDF export. To see or set your language preference, select the cog icon ![Screenshot of the cog icon.](media/end-user-pdf/power-bi-settings-icon.png) > **Settings** > **General** > **Language**.
* In the Power BI service, URL filters aren't currently respected when you choose **Current Values** for your export.
* Reports with unusual custom page sizes may experience issues in export scenarios. For best results, consider switching to a standard page size for your report.
* Reports using themes with custom fonts will have the custom font replaced with a default font.
* While we look to provide a consistent experience, we can't guarantee the exported PDF from the Power BI service will always match the exported PDF from a local Power BI Desktop file.
* We can't guarantee precise fidelity for Power BI reports. The resolution of exported report pages is 1280 pixels x 720 pixels. 
* Visuals with scrollbars are exported in their default state.  The visual will display all possible rows, starting with the first row. Even if you have the visual scrolled down, when exported, the visual will display unscrolled. 

    ![Export visual with scrollbars.](media/end-user-pdf/export-to-pdf-03.png)

* Visuals in a drilled down state are exported in their default state. 
* The feature doesn't export any wallpaper you may have applied to the report. Since wallpaper isn't exported to the PDF, you should pay special attention to reports that use dark wallpaper. If the text in your report is light or white, it will be difficult to read in the export to PDF process since the dark wallpaper won't be exported with the rest of the report. 
* All Power BI reports have a page margin when exported to PDF. That is, there will be a band of white space at the top and bottom of the exported file. 
* Export to PDF is not currently supported for tenants in the China North region.
