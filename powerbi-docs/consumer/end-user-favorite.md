# Favorite dashboards, reports, and apps in the Power BI service

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-yyny](../includes/consumer-appliesto-yyny.md)]

When you make content a *favorite*, you can access it quickly from the **Favorites** content list. Favorites are typically content that you visit most often and are identified with a filled star.

## Add a dashboard or report as a favorite

1. Open a dashboard or report that you use often. Even content that is shared with you can be a favorite.

2. From the upper menu bar of the Power BI service, select **Add to Favorites** or the star :::image type="icon" source="./media/end-user-favorite/power-bi-favorite-icon.png"::: icon.

   You can also favorite a dashboard or report from anywhere you see the star icon, such as Home, Recent, Apps, and Shared with me.

## Work with favorites

You have several options for viewing your favorites.

1. To see all the content that you added as favorites, on the **Browse** pane, select the **Favorites** tab.

   From here, you can take action. You can open a favorite, identify owners, and even share favorites with your colleagues.

2. Favorites are also available from Power BI Home. If you selected the **Expanded** display mode, your favorites are listed in the **Favorites + frequents** section. If you selected the **Simplified** display mode, your favorites are listed in the **Favorites** tab.

## Unfavorite content

If you no longer use a report, dashboard, or app as often as you used to, you can unfavorite it. When you unfavorite content, it's removed from your Favorites list but not from Power BI. Just select the black star to turn it back to a white star.

## Considerations and limitations

When you set an app as a favorite, it automatically favorites all the reports and dashboards for that app. It isn't possible to favorite individual app reports or dashboards.
