# Add favorites for dashboards, reports, and apps in Power BI

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-yyny](../includes/consumer-appliesto-yyny.md)]

When you mark content as a *favorite*, you access it quickly from the **Favorites** list. Favorites are content you visit most often and show a filled star.

## Add a dashboard or report as a favorite

1. Open a dashboard or report you use often. Shared content can be a favorite.

1. On the top menu bar in the Power BI service, select **Add to Favorites** or the star :::image type="icon" source="./media/end-user-favorite/power-bi-favorite-icon.png"::: icon.

   Favorite a dashboard or report anywhere you see the star icon, like Home, Recent, Apps, and Shared with me.

## Work with favorites

View your favorites in a few ways.

1. On the **Browse** pane, select the **Favorites** tab to see all your favorites.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/end-user-favorite/power-bi-browse.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Home page with the Favorites tab highlighted.":::

   Open a favorite, identify owners, and share favorites with colleagues.

1. Access favorites from Power BI Home: In the **Expanded** display mode they're in **Favorites + frequents**, and in the **Simplified** display mode they're on the **Favorites** tab.

## Unfavorite content

If you no longer use a report, dashboard, or app often, unfavorite it. Unfavoriting removes it from your Favorites list, not from Power BI. Select the black star to turn it white again.

## Mobile

In the Power BI mobile apps (iOS and Android):

- Tap the star in the header or item menu to favorite or unfavorite.
- Favorites sync across devices and the Power BI service.
- When you favorite an app, all dashboards and reports in that app are also favorited. You can't unfavorite them individually.
- To unfavorite, tap the filled star again.

## Considerations and limitations

When you favorite an app, you also favorite all its reports and dashboards. You can't favorite individual reports or dashboards in an app.
