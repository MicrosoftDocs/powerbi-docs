# Add spotlights to Power BI reports

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-yyny](../includes/consumer-appliesto-yyny.md)]

Use spotlights to draw attention to a specific visual on a report page.  

## Add a spotlight

1. [Open a report](end-user-report-open.md) in the Power BI service.

1. Select the visual that you want to highlight. Select the **More options (...)** dropdown, then choose **Spotlight**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the spotlight mode is active when you add a bookmark, that mode is retained in the bookmark.

1. The selected visual is highlighted, which causes all other visuals on the page to fade to near transparency.
