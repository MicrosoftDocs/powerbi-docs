# Frequently asked questions about Power BI

* If you have other questions, [try asking the Power BI Community](https://community.powerbi.com/).
* Still have an issue? Visit the [Power BI support page](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/support/).

## What is the Microsoft Power BI service?

The Power BI service is a cloud-based business analytics service that enables anyone to visualize and analyze data with greater speed, efficiency, and understanding. It connects users to a broad range of cloud-based and on-premises data through easy-to-use dashboards, interactive reports, and compelling visualizations that bring data to life. Read more about [Power BI](../fundamentals/power-bi-overview.md).

## Whatâ€™s the difference between Power BI Pro and Power BI Premium?

Power BI Pro is an individual license that allows access to all content and capabilities in the Power BI service. You can even share content and collaborate with other Pro users. Only Pro users can publish content to workspaces, share dashboards, and subscribe to dashboards and reports.

Power BI Premium provides dedicated capacity to deliver more consistent performance. It also supports larger data volumes in Power BI. For individual users, Premium enables widespread distribution of content by Pro users and it doesn't require per-user licenses for recipients viewing the content.

## What if I have questions about Power BI Premium?

For questions related to Power BI Premium, see [Power BI Premium FAQ](../service-premium-faq.md).

## What is Power BI Desktop?

Power BI Desktop is a free application you can install right on your own computers. Power BI Desktop works cohesively with the Power BI service.  Data scientists, admins, and developers work with Power BI Desktop to produce reports and make them available to the Power BI service *consumers*, like you.
