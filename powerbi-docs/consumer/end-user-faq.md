## What is Microsoft Power BI service?
Power BI service is a cloud-based business analytics service that enables anyone to visualize and analyze data with greater speed, efficiency, and understanding. It connects users to a broad range of cloud-based and on-premises data through easy-to-use dashboards, interactive reports, and compelling visualizations that bring data to life. Read more about [What is Power BI](../power-bi-overview.md).

## What’s the difference between Power BI Pro and Power BI Premium?
Power BI Pro is an individual license that allows access to all content and capabilities in the Power BI service, including the ability to share content and collaborate with other Pro users. Only Pro users can publish to and consume content from app workspaces, share dashboards, and subscribe to dashboards and reports. 

Premium provides dedicated capacity to deliver more consistent performance and support larger data volumes in Power BI. For individual users, Premium also enables widespread distribution of content by Pro users without requiring per-user licenses for recipients viewing the content.

## What happens if my Power BI Pro license expires?
There is a 30-day grace period after a Power BI Pro license expires.
