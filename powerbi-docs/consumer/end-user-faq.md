# Frequently asked questions about Power BI
* If you have other questions, [try asking the Power BI Community](http://community.powerbi.com/).
* Still have an issue? Please visit the [Power BI support page](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/support/).

## What is Microsoft Power BI service?
Power BI service is a cloud-based business analytics service that enables anyone to visualize and analyze data with greater speed, efficiency, and understanding. It connects users to a broad range of cloud-based and on-premises data through easy-to-use dashboards, interactive reports, and compelling visualizations that bring data to life. Read more about [What is Power BI](../power-bi-overview.md).

## Whatâ€™s the difference between Power BI Pro and Power BI Premium?
Power BI Pro is an individual license that allows access to all content and capabilities in the Power BI service, including the ability to share content and collaborate with other Pro users. Only Pro users can publish to and consume content from app workspaces, share dashboards, and subscribe to dashboards and reports. 

Premium provides dedicated capacity to deliver more consistent performance and support larger data volumes in Power BI. For individual users, Premium also enables widespread distribution of content by Pro users without requiring per-user licenses for recipients viewing the content.

## What happens if my Power BI Pro license expires?
There is a 30-day grace period after a Power BI Pro license expires.
Power BI Pro has the same subscription lifecycle as Office 365. For more information, see [What happens to my data and access when my Office 365 for business subscription ends?](https://support.office.com/article/What-happens-to-my-data-and-access-when-my-Office-365-for-business-subscription-ends-4436582f-211a-45ec-b72e-33647f97d8a3)

## What if I have questions about Power BI Premium?
For questions related to Power BI Premium, see [Power BI Premium FAQ](../service-premium-faq.md).

## How do I find out who in my organization has a Power BI account?
You can view the Azure Active Directory Integrated Applications report for Power BI to see the active users within your organization. The Azure AD report does not indicate what type of license each user has. It only reports which users have signed in to Power BI and when they logged in. For more information, see [Find Power BI users that have signed in](../service-admin-access-usage.md).

## What is Power BI Desktop?
Power BI Desktop is a free desktop application you can install right on your own computer. Power BI Desktop works cohesively with the Power BI service by providing advanced data exploration, shaping, modeling, and report creation with highly interactive visualizations. You can save your work to a file, and publish your data and reports right to your Power BI site to share with others. Read more about [What is Power BI Desktop](../desktop-what-is-desktop.md).

## What do I need to use Power BI service?
Just a Web browser and work email address. You can sign up with a .gov and .mil email address. See [Enroll your US Government organization in the Power BI service](../service-govus-signup.md) for more information 

## Why do I have to sign up with my work email?
Power BI does not support email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunications providers. Learn more about [the Power BI self-service sign-up process](../service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi.md).

## Is Power BI available on-premises?
The Power BI service [https://powerbi.com](https://powerbi.com) isn't available as a private, internal cloud service. However, you have three other options for viewing and working with data on premises.

With the [On-premises data gateway](../service-gateway-onprem.md), you can connect live to your on-premises SQL Server Analysis Services server, and other data sources. You can also set scheduled refresh with a centralized gateway. If a gateway is not available, you can refresh data from on-premises data sources using the [Power BI Gateway - Personal](../service-gateway-personal-mode.md).
