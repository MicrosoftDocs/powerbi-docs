# Collaborate in workspaces

 *Workspaces* are places to collaborate with colleagues on specific content. Workspaces are created by Power BI *designers* to hold collections of dashboards, reports, and apps. 

## Types of workspaces
**My Workspace** stores all the content that you own and create. Think of it as your personal sandbox or work area for your own content. For many Power BI consumers, **My workspace** remains empty because your job doesn't involve creating new content. Consumers, by definition, consume data created by others and use that data to make business decisions. If you find that you are creating content, consider reading [the Power BI articles for designers](../create-reports/index.md) instead.

**App workspaces** contain all the content for a specific app. When a *designer* creates an app, they bundle together all the content that is necessary for that app to be utilized. Content may include dashboards, reports, apps, and datasets. Not every app will contain these four pieces of content. An app may contain only one dashboard, or three of each content type, or even twenty reports. It all depends on what the *designer* includes in the app. Commonly, app workspaces for *consumers* won't include any datasets.

## Roles in the workspaces

Roles determine what you can do in a workspace, so teams can collaborate.  When granting access to a new workspace, *designers* add individuals or groups to one of the workspace roles: **Viewer**, **Member**, **Contributor**, or **Admin**. 

As a Power BI *consumer*, you'll interact in workspaces using the **Viewer** role. The Viewer role lets you view and interact with content (dashboards, reports, apps). <!--For a detailed list of what you can do as a *consumer* with the Viewer role, see [Viewer role in an organization with Premium](end-user-license.md#viewer-role-in-an-organization-with-a-premium-license).-->

## Licensing and workspaces
Licensing also plays a part in determining what you can and can't do in a workspace. For *consumers*, this typically means that your organization has a Premium license, you have a free per-user license, and the workspace is stored in Power BI Premium capacity.  If the workspace is not in Premium capacity, you will not be able to see or interact with it. To learn more, see [What license do I have?](end-user-license.md).

## Guest users
There may be occasions when you'll get invited to a workspace outside of your organization. You'll be a *guest* user. Guest *consumer* users can view and interact with content in that workspace.

A workspace is much more than a simple listing of content. On this page, you can learn a lot about the workspace's dashboards and reports. Take a few minutes to identify the content owner, last refreshed date, related content, and endorsements. If the workspace has a description, that description may help you gain a better understanding of the workspace's goals and how you might go about using it for your business purposes. And, if the workspace has a lot of content, use the search and sort options to find what you need, quickly.

Introduction to building blocks

For a Power BI consumer, the five building blocks are: visualizations, dashboards, reports, apps, and datasets. These are sometimes referred to as Power BI content. Content exists in workspaces. A typical workflow involves all of the building blocks: A Power BI designer (yellow in diagram below) collects data from datasets, brings it into Power BI for analysis, creates reports full of visualizations that highlight interesting facts and insights, pins visualizations from reports to a dashboard, and shares the reports and dashboards with consumers like you (black in diagram below). The designer shares them in the form of apps or other types of shared content.
