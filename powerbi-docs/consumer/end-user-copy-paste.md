# Copy a visual and then paste it into another application

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-yyyn](../includes/consumer-appliesto-yyyn.md)]

Have you ever wanted to share an image from a Power BI report or dashboard? Now you can copy a visual and paste it into other applications that support the paste option. Copy a visual and paste it into an email message, Word, PowerPoint, another Power BI report, and many more applications.

When you copy a static image of a visual, you get a copy of the visual along with the metadata. This includes the following:

* Link back to the Power BI report or dashboard
* Title of the report or dashboard
* Notice if the image contains confidential information
* Last updated time stamp
* Filters applied to the visual

## Copy the visual

The process is almost identical for copying a visual from a dashboard or a report. Only the first step varies.

1. Navigate to the report or dashboard that has the image that you want to copy.

1. Copy the visual.

    * **To copy from a dashboard.** On the upper right corner of the visual, select **More actions (...)**, then choose **Copy visual as image**.

    * **To copy from a report page.** From the upper right corner of the visual, select the icon for **Copy as image with caption**.

        :::image type="content" source="media/end-user-copy-paste/power-bi-copy-icon.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Copy as image with caption icon.":::

1. If there's a data sensitivity label applied to the report that contains the visual, you'll receive a warning. For more information, see [Data that has been labeled as confidential or sensitive](#data-that-has-been-labeled-as-confidential-or-sensitive).

    :::image type="content" source="media/end-user-copy-paste/power-bi-sensitive-dashboard.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a warning message about sensitive data.":::

1. When you see a dialog window appear with **Image with caption copied**, select **Copy**.

1. After your visual is copied, paste it into another application using **Ctrl + V** or **right-click** > **Paste**. The following screenshot shows the visual pasted into Microsoft Word.

## Data that has been labeled as confidential or sensitive

If there's a data sensitivity label applied to the report containing the visual, you'll receive a warning when you select the copy icon.  

:::image type="content" source="media//end-user-copy-paste/power-bi-sensitive.png" alt-text="Screenshot that displays a warning message about sensitive data.":::

A sensitivity label will also be added to the metadata of the copied visual. The sensitivity label will appear below the visual when you paste it.

## Considerations and troubleshooting

  :::image type="content" source="media//end-user-copy-paste/power-bi-copy-grey.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a visual with the Copy icon disabled.":::

Q: Why is the Copy icon disabled on a visual?  
A: We currently support native Power BI visuals and certified custom visuals. There's limited support for certain visuals. This includes:

* ESRI and other map visuals
* Python visuals
* R visuals
* PowerApps visuals

A: The ability to copy a visual can be turned off by your IT department or Power BI administrator.

Q: Why is my visual not pasting correctly?  
A: There are limitations for custom visuals and animated visuals. The following are some examples of visuals that won't paste correctly:

* [Licensed visuals](../developer/visuals/licensing-faq.yml#what-are-licensed-visuals-)
* [AppSource visuals that are managed in your organizational store](/fabric/admin/organizational-visuals#add-a-visual-from-appsoruce)

Q: Can I copy a visual from my embedded Power BI report?  
A: *Copy visual* is supported only in the **embed for your organization** scenario. It isn't available in the **embed for your customers** scenario.

Q: Can I copy and paste slicer visualizations in a report?

A: No, copying and pasting the slicer visualization is not supported. This includes visuals that use [Visual Filter APIs](../developer/visuals/filter-api.md) which act as slicers.
