# Customer intent: As a Power BI customer or potential customer, I want to get a definition of a Power BI consumer so I know if I am a consumer (versus admin, creator, or dev) and, as a consumer, what I can accomplish with Power BI service.

# Power BI for consumers
The way you interact with Power BI will depend on your job role. As an *end user* or *consumer*, you are the person who receives dashboards, reports, and apps from colleagues. You work in ***Power BI service*** to review and interact with this content in order to make business decisions.

If you're new to Power BI, we recommend first reading the [Power BI overview](../power-bi-overview.md). There you'll learn about the set of tools that make up Power BI.

As a consumer, you won't have access to the full capabilities of Power BI -- and that's ok, because your job isn't to build dashboards and reports. Your job is to use Power BI for analysis, monitoring, exploration, and decision-making.

As you read through the articles for consumers, you'll learn the terminology, you'll get a tour of Power BI service, figure out how to navigate to content, and then learn how to interact with that content.  So let's get started!
