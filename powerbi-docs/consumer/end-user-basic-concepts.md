# Basic concepts for the Power BI service business user

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-ynnm](../includes/consumer-appliesto-ynnm.md)]

Use this article to familiarize yourself with some of the terms and concepts associated with the Power BI service. Understanding these terms and concepts makes it easier for you to read through the other Power BI articles and to work in the Power BI service (app.powerbi.com).

### This article isn't about Power BI Desktop

You likely heard the term "Power BI Desktop" or just "Desktop." It's the stand-alone tool used by *designers* who build and share dashboards and reports with you. It's important to know that there are other Power BI tools out there. But, as long as you're a *business user*, you typically work with the Power BI service. This article applies only to the Power BI service.

For more information about the full suite of Power BI tools, see [What is Power BI?](../fundamentals/power-bi-overview.md).

## Let's get started
To follow along, open app.powerbi.com in your browser. 

There are many objects and concepts that make up the Power BI service, too many to cover in a single article. So this article introduces you to the most common:  **_visualizations_**, **_dashboards_**, **_reports_**, **_apps_**, and **_semantic models_** (formerly called *datasets*). These objects are sometimes referred to as *Power BI* **_content_**. *Content* exists within **_workspaces_**. 

A typical Power BI workflow involves more than one type of content. A Power BI *designer* (yellow in the diagram) collects data from *semantic models*, brings it into Power BI Desktop for analysis, and creates *reports* full of *visualizations* that highlight interesting facts and insights. The *designer* pins visualizations from reports to *dashboards*, and shares the reports and dashboards with *business users* like you (black in the diagram). 

There are many different ways that a *designer* can share content with you: as individual pieces of content, content bundled together in an *app*, or by giving you permissions to a workspace where the content is stored. (Don't worry, we talk about the different ways that content is shared later in this article.)

![A basic Power BI workflow chart.](media/end-user-basic-concepts/power-bi-workflows.png)

At its most basic:

- ![A screenshot of the visualization icon.](media/end-user-basic-concepts/visual.png) A **_visualization_** (or *visual*), is a type of chart built by Power BI *designers*. The visuals display the data from *reports* and *semantic models*. Because they're highly interactive, you can slice, filter, highlight, change, and even drill into visualizations.  

    For more info, see [Interact with visuals in reports, dashboards, and apps](end-user-visualizations.md).

- ![A screenshot of the semantic model icon.](media/end-user-basic-concepts/power-bi-semantic-model-icon.png) A *semantic model* is a container of data. For example, it might be an Excel file from the World Health Organization. It might also be a company-owned database of customers, or it might be a Salesforce file. And it might be all three if the *designer* combines them into a single model. *Designers* manage semantic models. The data contained in semantic models is used to build reports, dashboards, and apps that *designers* share with you. 

- ![A screenshot of the dashboard icon.](media/end-user-basic-concepts/power-bi-dashboard-icon.png) A *dashboard* is a single screen with *tiles* of interactive visuals, text, and graphics. A dashboard collects your most important metrics, or a focused set of metrics, on one screen, to tell a story or answer a question. The dashboard content comes from one or more reports and one or more semantic models.

    For more info, see [Dashboards for the Power BI service business users](end-user-dashboards.md).

- ![A screenshot of the report icon.](media/end-user-basic-concepts/power-bi-report-icon.png) A *report* is one or more pages of interactive visuals, text, and graphics that together make up a single report. Power BI bases a report on a single semantic model. Often, the *designer* organizes report pages to each address a central area of interest or answer a single question.

    For more info, see [Reports in Power BI](end-user-reports.md).

- ![A screenshot of the app icon.](media/end-user-basic-concepts/power-bi-app-icon.png) An *app* is a way for *designers* to bundle and share related dashboards, reports, and semantic models together. *Business users* receive some apps automatically but can go search for other apps created by colleagues or by the community. For example, out-of-the-box apps are available for external services you may already use, like Google Analytics and Microsoft Dynamics CRM.

To be clear, if you logged in to the Power BI service for the first time, you probably don't see any shared dashboards, apps, or reports yet.

## Workspaces

Workspaces are places to collaborate with colleagues on specific content. Workspaces are created by Power BI *designers* to hold collections of dashboards and reports. The *designer* can then share the workspace with colleagues. When a *designer* wants to share content with you, they assign you a workspace *role*. Your role in that workspace determines how you can interact with the content in that workspace. The roles are: Admin, Member, Contributor, and Viewer. 

*Designers* can also bundle a collection of dashboards and reports into an app and distribute it to the entire community, to their organization, or to specific people or groups. Certain types of apps called template apps, create a workspace when the app is installed. [Learn more about apps.](end-user-apps.md)

Everyone using the Power BI service also has a **My workspace**. **My workspace** is your personal sandbox where you create content for yourself.

To see your workspaces in Power BI select **Workspaces** from your navigation pane.

_______________________________________________________

## Semantic models

A *semantic model* is a collection of data that *designers* import or connect to and then use to build reports and dashboards. As a *business user*, it's possible that you never interact directly with semantic models, but it's still helpful to learn how they fit into the bigger picture.  

Each semantic model represents a single source of data. For example, the source could be an Excel workbook on OneDrive, an on-premises SQL Server Analysis Services tabular dataset, or a Google Analytics dataset. *Designers* can combine more than one source into a single semantic model. Power BI supports more than 150 data sources and is always adding more. 

When a *designer* shares an app with you, or gives you permissions to a workspace, you might be able to look up which semantic models are being used. But you can't add or change anything in the semantic model. This means that as you interact with Power BI content, the underlying data is safe. Changes you make to the dashboards and reports don't affect the semantic model. 

One semantic model...

- can be used over and over by report *designers* to create dashboards, reports, and apps.

- can be used to create many different reports.

- can have visuals from that one semantic model appear on many different dashboards.

  ![A graphic showing a semantic model with many to one relationships.](media/end-user-basic-concepts/power-bi-semantic-model-diagram.png)

To learn more about semantic models, visit these articles:
- [How do designers assign permissions to semantic models](../connect-data/service-datasets-build-permissions.md)    
- [How semantic models are shared with colleagues](../collaborate-share/service-share-dashboards.md)

On to the next building block, reports.

_______________________________________________________

## Reports

A Power BI report is one or more pages of visualizations, graphics, and text. All of the visualizations in a report come from a single semantic model. *Designers* build reports and share them with others; either individually or as part of an app. Typically, *business users* [interact with reports in *Reading view*](end-user-reading-view.md).

![Screenshot of a report with tabs.](media/end-user-basic-concepts/power-bi-report.png)

One report...

- Can be created using data from only one semantic model. Power BI Desktop can combine more than one data source into a single semantic model in a report, and that report can be imported into Power BI. 

- Can be associated with multiple dashboards (tiles pinned from that one report can appear on multiple dashboards).

- Can be part of multiple apps.

  ![A graphic showing the relationships for a report.](media/end-user-basic-concepts/power-bi-report-diagram.png)

_______________________________________________________

## Dashboards

A dashboard represents a customized graphical view of some subset of one or more underlying semantic models. *Designers* build dashboards and share them with *business users*; either individually or as part of an app. If a *business user* is given permissions to a report, they can build their own dashboards too. A dashboard is a single canvas that has *tiles*, graphics, and text.

Dashboards can look similar to a report page. You know that you're on a dashboard if you see a natural language query field in the upper left corner. Also, when you select a visual tile on a dashboard, you jump to the underlying report or to a URL or to the natural language query that was used to create that tile. For more explanation, see [Reports versus dashboards](end-user-reports.md#dashboards-versus-reports).

  ![Screenshot of a sample dashboard](media/end-user-basic-concepts/power-bi-dashboard.png)

Typically, a dashboard *tile* is pinned from a report. Most pinned tiles show a [visualization](end-user-visualizations.md) that a *designer* created from a semantic model, saved in a report, and then pinned to that dashboard. A tile can also contain an entire report page, can contain live streaming data, or a video. There are many ways that *designers* add tiles to dashboards, too many to cover in this overview article. To learn more, see [Dashboard tiles in Power BI](end-user-tiles.md).

*Business users* can't edit dashboards. You can however add comments, view related data, subscribe, and more.

What are some purposes for dashboards? Here are just a few:

- To see, in one glance, all the information needed to make a decision

- To distill and monitor the most-important information about your business

- To ensure all colleagues are on the same page; viewing and using the same data

- To monitor the health of a business or product or business unit or marketing campaign, and so on

- To create a personalized view of a larger dashboard, containing all the metrics that matter to you

**ONE** dashboard...

- Can display visualizations from many different semantic models

- Can display visualizations from many different reports

- Can display visualizations pinned from other tools (for example, Excel)

## Visualizations

Visualizations (also known as visuals) display insights that Power BI discovers in the data. Visualizations make it easier to interpret the insight, because your brain can comprehend a picture quicker than it can comprehend a spreadsheet of numbers.

Just some of the visualizations available in Power BI are: waterfall, ribbon, tree map, pie, funnel, card, scatter, and gauge.

   ![A screenshot of eight sample visuals.](media/end-user-basic-concepts/power-bi-visuals.png)

See the [full list of visualizations included with Power BI](../visuals/power-bi-visualization-types-for-reports-and-q-and-a.md).

### Custom visuals
If you receive a report with a visual you don't recognize, and you don't see it included in the [full list of visualizations included with Power BI](../visuals/power-bi-visualization-types-for-reports-and-q-and-a.md), likely it's a *custom visual*. Custom visuals are created by Power BI community members and submitted to Power BI for use in reports. 

_______________________________________________________

## Apps

These collections of dashboards and reports organize related content together into a single package. Power BI *designers* build them in workspaces and share apps with individuals, groups, entire organizations, or the public. As a *business user*, you can be confident that you and your colleagues are working with the same information; a single trusted version of the truth.

Sometimes, the app's workspace itself is shared, and there can be many people collaborating and updating both the workspace and the app. The extent of what you can do with an app is determined by the permissions and access you're given.

> [!NOTE]
> The use of apps requires a Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) license, or for the app workspace to be stored in Premium capacity. [Learn about licenses](end-user-license.md).

Apps are easy to find and install in the [Power BI service](https://powerbi.com) and on your mobile device. After you install an app, you don't have to remember the names of a lot of different dashboards and reports. They're all together in one app, in your browser, or on your mobile device.

This app has two dashboards and two reports that make up a single app. Selecting an arrow to the right of a report name displays a list of the pages that make up that report.

![Screenshot of related content for the selected app.](media/end-user-basic-concepts/power-bi-app-display.png)

Whenever the app is updated, you automatically see the changes. Also, the *designer* controls the schedule for how often Power BI refreshes the data. You don't need to worry about keeping it up-to-date.

You can get apps in a few different ways:

- The app *designer* can install the app automatically in your Power BI account.

- The app *designer* can send you a direct link to an app.

- You can search from within the Power BI service for apps available to you from your organization or from the community. You can also visit [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps?product=power-bi), where you find all the apps that you can use.

In Power BI on your mobile device, you can only install apps from a direct link, and not from AppSource. If the app *designer* installs the app automatically, you see it in your list of apps.

Once you install the app, just select it from your Apps list and choose which dashboard or report to open and explore first.
