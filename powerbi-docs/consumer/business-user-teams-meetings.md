# Use data to make meetings productive in Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-ynny](../includes/consumer-appliesto-ynny.md)]

In meetings, it's important to keep everyone on track towards shared objectives. This article shows you how to use data, trends, and metrics to demonstrate the impact of the work you and your team are doing.
It's easy to use Power BI in meetings to help keep crucial data top of mind. It helps everyone know which data is the most important and builds skills that help your team make agile decisions based on your progress toward objectives. By staying focused on driving towards measurable outcomes, your team gains a sense of the positive impact of their work.

Here's how you can use data before, during, and after your meetings.

- **[Before the meeting](#before-the-meeting)**. Add the reports and scorecards directly to the meeting invite so everyone can access them.
- **[During the meeting](#during-the-meeting)**. Open and present these reports from the calendar. You can even use chat to share more reports and scorecards or to find answers to questions raised in the meeting.
- **[After the meeting](#after-the-meeting)**. Send a summary with the key results discussed and actions the team decided to take to help achieve the desired outcomes.

## Before the meeting

To get ready for the meeting, add a Power BI report or scorecard to the meeting invite. Review the data in the report or scorecard and encourage other participants to do the same. Then everyone is ready for the meeting.
