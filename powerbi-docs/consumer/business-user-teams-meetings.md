# Use data to make meetings productive in Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-ynny](../includes/consumer-appliesto-ynny.md)]

In meetings, keeping everyone on track towards shared objectives is important. Use data, trends, and metrics to show the impact of the work you and your team are doing.

It’s easy to use Power BI in meetings to help keep important data top of mind. It helps everyone know which data is the most important, and builds skills that help your team make agile decisions based on your progress towards objectives. By staying focused on driving towards measurable outcomes, your team gains a sense of the positive impact their work is having.

Here's how you can use data before, during, and after your meetings.

- **[Before the meeting](#before-the-meeting)**, add the reports and scorecards directly to the meeting invite so everyone has access to them. 
- **[During the meeting](#during-the-meeting)**, open and present these reports from the calendar. You can even use chat to share more reports and scorecards, or to quickly find the right data to answer questions raised in the meeting. 
- **[After the meeting](#after-the-meeting)**, send a summary with key results that you discussed and actions the team decided to take to help achieve the desired outcomes.

## Ask data-driven questions

Here are the kinds of questions you can add to your meeting agenda, to jump start discussion and determine the best actions to take to achieve your desired outcomes:

- **Are we making progress** toward our objectives as quickly as we expected to?
- **What actions can we take** in the next week or month that are most likely to improve our metrics?
- **What metrics can we start tracking** to get a better sense of if we’re making progress towards our desired outcomes?

Review your data weekly, or at least monthly, to get in the habit of asking questions, discussing the best actions to take in the next week or two, and helping the team learn to leverage data as they plan their work.

## Before the meeting

To get ready for the meeting, add a Power BI report or scorecard to the meeting invite. You review the data in the report or scorecard, and encourage other participants to do the same. Then everyone is ready for the meeting.

### Add Power BI

Here's how to add a Power BI report or scorecard to a meeting.

1. Create the meeting and invite others.
2. Send the meeting invite.
3. Select **Edit** to open the meeting in the calendar. You only see the option to edit if you're the meeting organizer.

5. Navigate to a report or scorecard and select it.

4. Select **Save**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-meetings/teams-power-bi-save-tab.png" alt-text="Select Save to add this report or scorecard to the meeting tab.":::

1. See [Give team members permission](business-user-teams-share-data.md#give-team-members-permission) in the "Lead data-driven discussions in Microsoft Teams" article for how to share with your colleagues.

1. Add an agenda item to the meeting to review and discuss the data.

### Review the data

It's a good idea to review your data in Power BI before a meeting.

1. Open the meeting from the calendar.
2. Open the Power BI tab that has the report or scorecard.
3. Review the report or scorecard.

Consider setting a reminder for your meeting so attendees can also pre-read the data before the meeting. This helps everyone be aware of the latest data, and improves the discussion during the meeting.

## During the meeting

When you’re in a meeting, data can help guide the discussion or answer questions raised by attendees. It’s easy to present data in Power BI during the meeting, share links to data with meeting attendees, and find data that can answer questions.

1. After joining the meeting, navigate to the Teams window.
2. Open the calendar in Teams.
3. Open the meeting in the calendar.
4. Anyone in the meeting can select the Power BI tab to view the report that you added to the meeting.

5. Use the meeting window to present your screen.

### Capture visuals that are important for everyone to see

3. Select **Copy visual as image** to copy the visual.

4. Paste the visual into the meeting chat.

### Send a message in the meeting chat from a report

1. View the report in the Power BI app in Teams or in the Power BI service.
2. Select the report or a specific visual.
3. Select the **Chat in Teams** button.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-meetings/power-bi-teams-chat-teams.png" alt-text="Screenshot of select the Chat in Teams icon in a report.":::

5. Type your message above the link that's provided.

### Answer questions with data in chat

1. Open the meeting chat.
2. Select **Messaging extensions (...)**.

## After the meeting

It’s useful to share a summary of the most important data points discussed and the actions the team will take to help achieve outcomes. If you captured visuals during the meeting in chat, you can pull those into a meeting summary post in chat or a follow-up message.

Consider using key data points to create goals and track them in a scorecard. Consistently tracking progress against with a goal through a series of meetings is a great way to keep your team or project on track.
