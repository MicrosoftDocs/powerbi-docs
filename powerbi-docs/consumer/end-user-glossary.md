# Glossary for Power BI service
The Power BI service may introduce terminology that is unfamiliar or confusing. The glossary is a great place to look up terminology, you might even want to keep it bookmarked. Another great resource for learning about the building blocks that make up Power BI service is [Basic Concepts](end-user-basic-concepts.md). Basic Concepts gives a high level overview of the Power BI *pieces* and how they're connected.

This glossary is a community effort.  Don't see a word here? Please ask us to add it (you can use the documentation feedback button at the bottom of this article.

## A

**account**

**admin portal**
The location where Power BI admins manage users, features, and settings for Power BI in their organization. (Note: Office 365, Azure, and PowerApps use admin center.)

**aggregates**
When the values of multiple rows are grouped together as input on criteria to form a single value of more significant meaning or measurement.

**aggregation**
The reduction of rows in underlying data sources to fit in a model. The result is an aggregate.

**alert, alerts**
A feature that notifies users of changes in the data based on limits they set. Alerts can be set on tiles pinned from report visuals. Users receive alerts on the service and on their mobile app.

**annotate**
To write lines, text, or stamps on a snapshot copy of a tile, report, or visual on the Power BI mobile app for iOS and Android devices.

**app, apps** 


**AppSource**
Centralized online repository where you can browse and discover dashboards, reports, datasets, and apps to download.

**ArcGIS for Power BI**
ArcGIS is a mapping and analytics platform created by the company ESRI. The name of the visual included in the Power BI visuals library is called ArcGIS for Power BI.

**assign**
[Power BI Premium] Verb for moving a workspace into or out of dedicated capacity. Don't use promote for moving a workspace to dedicated capacity because this has the connotation of dedicated being superior to shared capacity. 

**Auto Insights**
Are now called *Quick Insights*.

## B

**BI, business intelligence**

**bookmark**
A view of data captured in the Bookmarks pane of a report in Power BI Desktop or service. In Desktop, the bookmarks are saved in the .pbix report file for sharing on the Power BI service
  
**breadcrumbs**
The navigation at the top left to quickly navigate between reports and dashboards.

## C

**calculation**
A mathematical determination of the size or number of something.

**card** (visual type)
A Power BI [visual type](end-user-visual-type.md).

**card** (Power BI Home)
Power BI Home displays rectangular and square pictures that represent dashboards, reports, apps, and more. These pictures are referred to as *cards*.

**certified custom visual**
A Power BI custom visual that has met requirements and passed strict security testing.

**classification**
Also called data classification. This option can be turned on by Power BI admins to raise awareness of the level of security required for a dashboard. The classification types can be customized by an organization.

**connect live**
A method of connecting to SQL Server Analysis Services data models. Also called a live connection.

**container**
The areas on the navigation pane are *containers*. In the nav pane you'll find containers for: Favorites, Recent, Apps, Shared with me, and Home. 

**content**
Content for the Power BI service is generally dashboards, reports, and apps. It can also include workbooks and datasets.

**content list**
The content index for an app.

**content pack**
 A collection of pre-packaged datasets, reports, and dashboards. These are being replaced with **apps**, learn [about the new workspace experience](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/service-create-the-new-workspaces). 

**content view**

**Continuous variable** - a continuous variable can be any value between its minimum and maximum limits, otherwise it is a discrete variable. Examples are temperature, weight, age, and time. Continuous variables can include fractions or portions of the value. The total number of blue skateboards sold is a discrete variable since we can't sell half a skateboard.

**Correlation** - a correlation tells us how the behavior of things are related.  If their patterns of increase and decrease are similar, then they are positively correlated. And if their patterns are opposite, then they are negatively correlated. For example, if sales of our red skateboard increase each time we run a tv marketing campaign, then sales of the red skateboard and the tv campaign are positively correlated.

**cross-filter** 
Applies to visual interactions. 
Cross-filtering removes data that doesn't apply. For example, selecting **Moderation** in the doughnut chart cross-filters the line chart. The line chart now only displays data points that apply to the Moderation segment.

**cross-highlight**
Applies to visual interactions. Cross-highlighting retains all the original data points but dims the portion that does not apply to your selection. For example, selecting **Moderation** in the doughnut chart cross-highlights the column chart. The column chart dims all the data that does not apply to the Moderation segment and highlights all the data that does apply to the Moderation segment.

**custom visual**
Visuals that are created by the community and Microsoft. They can be downloaded from the Office store for use in Power BI reports.
