# Glossary for Power BI service

Another great resource for learning about the building blocks that make up Power BI service is [Basic Concepts](end-user-basic-concepts.md). Basic Concepts gives a high level overview of the Power BI *pieces* and how they're connected.

This glossary is a community effort.  Don't see a word here? Please ask us to add it (you can use the documentation feedback button at the bottom of this article.
