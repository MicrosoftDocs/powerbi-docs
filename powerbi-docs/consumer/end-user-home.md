# Find your dashboards, reports, and apps

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-yynn](../includes/consumer-appliesto-yynn.md)]

In Power BI, the term *content* refers to visuals, apps, dashboards, and reports. Power BI designers create content and share that content with their colleagues. Your content is accessible and viewable in the Power BI service, and often the best place to start working in the Power BI service is from Power BI **Home**.

## Explore Power BI Home

After you sign in to the Power BI service, select **Home** from the navigation pane.

:::image type="content" source="media/end-user-home/power-bi-open-home.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the nav pane for the Power BI service with Home selected.":::

Your Home page opens. The layout and content on Home is different for every user. New users have less content, but that changes as they use Power BI more often. Only the content that you can access appears on your Home. For example, if you don't have permissions to a report, that report doesn't appear on Home. 

## Simplified layout and Expanded layout

Your Home view depends on the layout you select. The **Simplified** view is the default. This view shows **Recommended** content at the top with tabs for **Recent**, **Favorites**, and **My apps**. **Recommended** content might include content that:

- Is marked as a favorite
- Is visited often
- Is visited often by colleagues in your organization
- Is featured on Home
- Is used frequently by your closest colleagues
- Is *getting started* content

The following example shows a **Simplified** layout for a new user.

The next example shows a **Simplified** layout for an experienced user.

The **Expanded** layout includes a different set of information. If you select the **Expanded** view from the View menu, the expanded layout becomes your default Home layout.

The following example shows the **Expanded** view for an experienced user.

## Locate content from your Home canvas

Power BI Home offers three ways of locating and viewing your content. All three approaches access the same pool of content in different ways. Searching is sometimes the easiest and quickest way to find something, while other times, selecting a card on the Home canvas is your best option.

- The Home canvas shows your favorite, frequent, recent, recommended, apps, and workspaces. If you're new to the Power BI service, you also have *getting started* content. To open content, select a card or an item in a list.
- Along the left side is a navigation pane, referred to as the nav pane. The nav pane has the same content as Home, but organized differently. Select **Browse** to see your recent, favorite, and shared content. Select **Data hub** to see data available to you from across your organization. Select **Apps** to see a list of apps available to you. And select **Learn** to see learning materials, sample reports, and training.
- At the top of Home, use the global search box to search for content by title, name, or keyword.

The following sections review these options for finding and viewing content.

## Home canvas

On the Home canvas, view all content that you have permission to use. At first, you might not have much content, but that changes as you start to use Power BI with your colleagues.

As you work in the Power BI service, you receive dashboards, reports, and apps from colleagues, and Power BI Home fills in with content. 

Every Home landing page looks different. Power BI optimizes Home based on your usage, settings, and the layout you select.

## Most important content at your fingertips

### Favorites and frequents

The **Favorites + frequents** section of Home contains links to the content that you visited most often or that you tagged as a [favorite](end-user-favorite.md). These cards have black stars because they're tagged as favorites.

:::image type="content" source="./media/end-user-home/power-bi-home-favorites.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the Favorites and frequents section.":::

### Featured

The **Featured** section contains content that your administrator or colleagues promoted to your Home. Typically, the content that they feature is important or helpful for you to do your job. In this example, the featured content includes metrics to track success. Unless it's been disabled by your administrator, any user with Administrator, Member, or Contributor permissions to a workspace can feature content on Home. For more information about featuring content on Home, see [Feature content on colleagues' Power BI Home](../collaborate-share/service-featured-content.md).

:::image type="content" source="./media/end-user-home/power-bi-home-featured.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Featured section on Home.":::

### Categorized content

The next section of Home contains two or more tabbed lists.

- **All** displays content from all the other tabs combined. 

- **Recent** displays content you visited most recently. Notice the timestamp for each item.

- **Shared** displays content that your colleagues shared with you.

- **Favorites** displays content you tagged as a [Favorites](end-user-favorite.md).

- **My apps** lists [apps that are shared with you](end-user-apps.md) or that you [downloaded from AppSource](end-user-apps.md). The most recent apps are listed here.

- **From external orgs** (Preview) lists shared semantic models available from other tenants. Use this list to discover and connect to data from external providers.

:::image type="content" source="./media/end-user-home/power-bi-tabbed-content.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Home list view with the Recent tab selected.":::

### Getting started learning resources

The exact resources that appear depend on your activity, settings, and Power BI administrator. If you're a new user, you might see *getting started* content. If you don't want to see *getting started* content on Home, select **Hide getting started**. 

*Getting started* resources, samples, and other learning content is always available from the **Learn** tab in your nav pane.  

:::image type="content" source="./media/end-user-home/power-bi-get-started.png" alt-text="A screenshot of Getting started section on Home.":::

## Explore the navigation pane

The nav pane classifies your content in ways that help you find what you need quickly.  

:::image type="content" source="media/end-user-home/power-bi-nav-pane.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the navigation pane on Home.":::

Use the nav pane to locate and move between dashboards, reports, apps, and other content. Occasionally, using the nav pane is the quickest way to get to content. The nav pane is there when you open your Home landing page and remains there as you open other areas of the Power BI service. 
  
The nav pane organizes your content into containers that are similar to what you also see on the Home canvas. Select the **Browse** tab to display lists of your **Recent**, **Favorites**, and **Shared with me** content. 

The number of visible buttons on the nav pane depends on space. To view hidden buttons, select the ellipses (...). As you open workspaces, they appear below **My workspace**. To remove the workspace from the nav pane, select the X. Selecting the X doesn't delete the workspace, it only removes it from the nav pane. To reopen a workspace, select it from **Workspaces**.

Quickly find the content you want on the nav pane. Content is organized similar to the Home canvas, but shows lists instead of cards.

### Workspaces

Every Power BI service user has one **My workspace**. **My workspace** only contains content that you download from Microsoft samples or that you create yourself. For many business users, **My workspace** is empty and remains empty.

:::image type="content" source="./media/end-user-home/power-bi-one-workspace.png" alt-text="A screenshot of My workspace on the navigation pane.":::

The following example shows what your workspace looks like if it's empty.

:::image type="content" source="./media/end-user-home/power-bi-empty-workspace.png" alt-text="A screenshot of an empty workspace in the Power BI service.":::

If someone in your organization adds you to a workspace, it appears in your list of workspaces. Over time, you might have more than one workspace. For example, your coworkers can add you to a workspace by giving you a role, such as Member, Contributor, or Viewer. If you download a template app from outside your organization, you get an app and a new workspace. You can also create workspaces if you have a paid license. To open a workspace, select it from the nav pane.

:::image type="content" source="./media/end-user-home/power-bi-workspace-lists.png" alt-text="A screenshot of Workspaces in the navigation pane.":::

The workspace opens on your canvas, and the name of the workspace is listed on your nav pane. When you open a workspace, you can view its content. It includes content such as dashboards, reports, worksheets, and dataflows. In the following example, the **Content & Learning** workspace is open and it contains several types of content.

:::image type="content" source="./media/end-user-home/power-bi-workspace-contents.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the Events workspace.":::

## Search all your content

Sometimes, the fastest way to find your content is to search for it. For example, if a dashboard that you don't use often isn't showing up on your Home canvas. Or, if your colleague shared something with you, but you don't remember the title or what type of content they shared. Sometimes, you might have so much content that it's easier to search for it rather than scrolling or sorting.

To search, use the search field, which is in the upper right corner of the Home menu bar. Enter the full or partial name of the content you're looking for. You can also enter your colleague's name to search for content that they shared with you. The search finds matches in all the content that you own or have access to.
