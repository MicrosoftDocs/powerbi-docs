# Change the display of a report page

People view reports on many different devices with varying screen sizes and aspect ratios. Change the way a report page displays to fit your needs.

## Explore the View menu

The options in the **View** menu give you flexibility to display report pages at the size and width you choose:

- Let's say you're viewing a report on a small device and it's hard to see titles and legends.  Select **View** > **Actual size** to increase the size of the report page. Use the scroll bars to move around the report.

- Another option is to fit the report to your screen width by selecting **Fit to width**. Since it's just the width and not the height, you may still need to use the vertical scroll bar.

- If you don't want any scroll bars, but want to make the best use of your screen size, select **Fit to Page**.

- You can also choose from four **High contrast colors**: High contrast #1, High contrast #2, High contrast black, and High contrast white. It's an accessibility feature that you can use so people who may have impaired vision can see the reports better:

- The final option, **Full screen**, displays your report page without menu bars and headers. Full screen may be a good choice for small screens where the details are hard to see.  Full screen may also be a good choice when projecting report pages on large screens for people to view but not interact.

When you exit the report, your **View** settings aren't saved, but revert to the default. If it's important to you to save these settings, use [bookmarks](end-user-bookmarks.md).
