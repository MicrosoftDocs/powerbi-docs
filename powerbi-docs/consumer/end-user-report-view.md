# Change the display of a report page

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-yynn](../includes/consumer-appliesto-yyny.md)]

You can view reports on many devices with varying screen sizes and aspect ratios. Learn how to change the display of a report page, so it fits your needs.

## Explore the View menu

The options in the **View** menu give you flexibility to display report pages at the size and width you choose.

:::image type="content" source="media/end-user-report-view/power-bi-menu-view.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the View menu options on the action bar.":::

If you view a report on a small device, it might be hard to see titles and legends. Select **View** > **Actual size** to increase the size of the report page. Use the scroll bars to move around the report.

Fit the report to your screen width by selecting **Fit to width** from the **View** menu. Because it adjusts the width and not the height, you might need to use the vertical scroll bar.

If you don't want any scroll bars, but you want to make the best use of your screen size, select **Fit to Page** from the **View** menu.

Change your display colors by selecting **High contrast colors** in the **View** menu. Select one of the options, such as High-contrast #1, High-contrast #2, High-contrast black, or High-contrast white. This feature gives people with impaired vision options to see the reports better. The example below is the High-contrast #1 option.

Select **Full screen** in the **View** menu to display your report page without menu bars and headers. Full screen is a good choice for small screens where the details might be hard to see. Full screen can also be a good choice when projecting report pages on a large screen for people to view but not interact with.  

:::image type="content" source="media/end-user-report-view/power-bi-full-screen.png" alt-text="A screenshot of a report in full screen mode.":::

When you exit the report, your **View** settings aren't saved. The changes revert to the default view settings. If you want to save these settings, you can preserve them as a [bookmark](end-user-bookmarks.md).

## Use your browser to change page display

Use the zoom controls in your browser to increase or decrease the available canvas area. Decreasing the zoom expands the available canvas area, and increasing the zoom decreases the available canvas area.

:::image type="content" source="media/end-user-report-view/power-bi-zoom.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the browser zoom controls.":::

## Zoom in on a visual

To examine a single visual in more detail, use **focus mode** or **full screen mode**.

### Focus mode

Focus mode expands a visual to fill the canvas while keeping the Filters pane accessible. Hover over a visual and select the **Focus mode** icon, or select **More options (...)** > **Open in focus mode** on dashboard tiles.

:::image type="content" source="media/end-user-report-view/power-bi-focus-mode.png" alt-text="A screenshot of a visual open in focus mode.":::

In focus mode, you can view and modify filters to explore your data. Filter changes are saved automatically for report visuals (select **Reset to default** to discard), but not for dashboard tiles. For report visuals, all filter levels are available (Visual, Page, Drillthrough, and Report). For dashboard tiles, only Visual level filters are available.

To exit, select **Exit focus mode** or **Back to report**.

### Full screen mode

Full screen mode removes all UI elements for presentations or kiosk displays. Select **View** > **Full screen** for reports, or the full screen icon for dashboards. To view a single visual in full screen, open it in focus mode first.

:::image type="content" source="media/end-user-report-view/power-bi-visual-full-screen.png" alt-text="A screenshot of a visual open in full screen mode.":::

Move your cursor to display navigation options at the bottom of the screen, including **Fit to page**, **Fit to width**, and page navigation arrows.
