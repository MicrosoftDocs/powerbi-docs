# **Recent** content in the Power BI service
Recent content is the last items you visited in the Power BI service, up to a maximum of 20 items.  These include: dashboards, reports, apps, and workbooks.

> [!NOTE]
> This video uses an older version of the Power BI service.

## Display recent content
To see your five most-recently visited items, from the nav pane, select the arrow to the right of **Recent**.  From here you can select recent content to open it. Only the five most-recent items are listed.

If you have more than five recently-visited items, select **See all** to open the Recent screen. You can also select **Recent**, or the Recent ![Recent icon](./media/end-user-recent/power-bi-icon.png)  icon, from the nav pane.

## Actions available from the **Recent** content list
The actions available to you will depend on the settings assigned by the content *designer*. Some of your options may include:
* Select the star icon to [favorite a dashboard, report, or app](end-user-favorite.md) ![star icon](./media/end-user-shared-with-me/power-bi-star-icon.png).
* Some dashboards and reports can be re-shared  ![share icon](./media/end-user-shared-with-me/power-bi-share-icon-new.png).
* [Open the report in Excel](end-user-export.md) ![export to Excel icon](./media/end-user-shared-with-me/power-bi-excel.png) 
* [View insights](end-user-insights.md) that Power BI finds in the data ![insights icon](./media/end-user-shared-with-me/power-bi-insights.png).
* Additionally, if your lists get long, [use the search field and sorting to find what you need](end-user-search-sort.md). To find out if a column can be sorted, hover to see if an arrow appears. In this example, hovering over **Last access** reveals an arrow -- your recent content can be sorted by access date.
