# Recent content in the Power BI service

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-yyny](../includes/consumer-appliesto-yyny.md)]

**Recent** content contains the last items you visited in the Power BI service. Recent content includes: dashboards, reports, apps, datasets, workspaces, and workbooks. When you select **Recent** on the Home pane, Power BI displays this content in descending order by date.  To change the sort order, select one of the headings and choose ascending or descending.

Any items that are marked as [favorites](end-user-favorite.md) have a star icon :::image type="icon" source="./media/end-user-recent/power-bi-favorite-shaded-icon.png":::, while items that are stored in [Premium capacity](end-user-license.md) have a diamond icon :::image type="icon" source="./media/end-user-recent/power-bi-diamond-icon.png":::.

## Search and sort your list of recent content

If your lists get long, use the **Filter by keyword** field, **Filter** button, and column sorting function to find what you need.

- Enter a keyword into the **Filter by keyword** field to show only recent content that includes that keyword.
- Use the Filter drop-down to sort your content according to the value of the **Type**, **Opened**, or **Endorsement** column.
- Click a column heading to display a sorting arrow. In this example, hovering over **Location** reveals an arrow &mdash;recent content can be sorted alphabetically by location content type.
