# **Recent** content in the Power BI service

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-yyny](../includes/consumer-appliesto-yyny.md)]

**Recent** content contains the last items you visited in the Power BI service. This include: dashboards, reports, apps, workspaces, and workbooks. When you select **Recent** from the nav bar, Power BI displays this content in descending order by date.  To change the sort order, select one of the headings and choose ascending or descending.

Notice that two items are [favorites](end-user-favorite.md), they have a star icon. And one item, the Customer Profitability Sample, is stored in [Premium capacity](end-user-license.md).

## See your five most recents

To display only your five most recently visited items, from the nav pane, select the arrow to the right of **Recent**.  From here, select content to open it.

## See all of your recent content

If you have more than five recently visited items, select **See all** to open the **Recent** screen. As we did at the beginning of this article, you can skip the flyout and open the **Recent** screen by selecting the word **Recent**, or its icon ![Recent icon](./media/end-user-recent/power-bi-icon.png), from the nav pane.

## Search and sort your list of recent content

If your lists get long, [use the search field and sorting to find what you need](end-user-search-sort.md). To find out if a column can be sorted, hover to see if an arrow appears. In this example, hovering over **Type** reveals an arrow -- your recent content can be sorted alphabetically by type of content.
