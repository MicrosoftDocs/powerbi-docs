# Subscribe to a report or dashboard in Power BI service (app.powerbi.com)
It's never been easier to stay up-to-date on your most important dashboards and reports. Subscribe yourself and your colleagues to report pages and dashboards that matter most to you, and Power BI will email a snapshot to your inbox. You tell Power BI how often you want to receive the emails: from once a day to once a week. 

The email and snapshot will use the language set in Power BI settings (see [Supported languages and countries/regions for Power BI](../supported-languages-countries-regions.md)). If no language is defined, Power BI uses the language according to the locale setting in your current browser. To see or set your language preference, select the cog icon ![gear icon](./media/end-user-subscribe/power-bi-settings-icon.png) > **Settings > General > Language**. 

![Language dropdown](./media/end-user-subscribe/power-bi-language.png)

Subscriptions can only be created in Power BI service. When you receive the email it will include a link to "go to report or dashboard". On mobile devices with Power BI apps installed, selecting this link launches the app (as opposed to the default action of opening the report or dashboard on the Power BI website).


## Requirements
- **Creating** a subscription is a Power BI Pro feature and you must have edit permissions to the content (dashboard or report) to create that subscription. 
- Since subscription emails are only sent when a dataset is updated or refreshes, subscriptions don't work on datasets that don't update or refresh.

## Subscribe to a dashboard or a report page
Whether you're subscribing to a dashboard or report, the process is very similar. The same button allows you to subscribe yourself (and others) to Power BI service dashboards and reports.
 
![select the Subscribe icon](./media/end-user-subscribe/power-bi-subscribe-orientation.png).

1. Open the dashboard or report.
2. From the top menubar, select **Subscribe** or select the envelope icon ![Subscribe icon](./media/end-user-subscribe/power-bi-icon-envelope.png).
   
   ![Subscribe icon](./media/end-user-subscribe/power-bi-subscribe-icon.png)

3. Use the yellow slider to turn the subscription on and off.  Setting the slider to Off will not delete the subscription. To delete the subscription, select the trashcan icon.

4. Fill in the email message details. Your email is prepopulated but you can add others to the subscription as well. Only email addresses in the same domain can be added (see **Considerations and troubleshooting** below for more details). If the report or dashboard is hosted in [Premium capacity](../service-premium.md), you'll be able to subscribe others using individual email addresses and group aliases. If the report or dashboard is not hosted in Premium capacity, you can still subscribe others using their individual email addresses, but they too must have Power BI Pro licenses.

    In the screenshots below, notice that when you subscribe to a report, you're actually subscribing to a report *page*.  To subscribe to more than one page in a report, select **Add another subscription** and select a different page.

5. Select **Save and close** to save the subscription. Those subscribed will receive an email and snapshot of the dashboard or report page each time any of the underlying datasets change. If the dashboard or report refreshes more than once a day, the email is only sent after the first refresh.

   > [!TIP]
   > Want to see the email right away? Trigger an email by refreshing one of the datasets associated with the dashboard or the dataset associated with the report. (If you don't have edit permissions to the dataset, you will have to ask someone who has those permissions to do this for you.) To find out which datasets are being used, select the **View related** icon ![View related icon](./media/end-user-subscribe/power-bi-view-related.png) to open **Related content** and then select the refresh icon  ![refresh icon](./media/end-user-subscribe/power-bi-refresh.png).

## How the email schedule is determined
The following table describes how frequently you will receive an email. It all depends on the connection method of the dataset upon which the dashboard or report is based (DirectQuery, Live connection, imported to Power BI, or Excel file in OneDrive or SharePoint Online) and on the subscription options available and selected (daily, weekly, or none).

|  | **DirectQuery** | **Live Connect** | **Scheduled refresh (import)** | **Excel file in OneDrive/SharePoint Online** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **How often does the report/dashboard get refreshed?** |Every 15m |Power BI checks every 15 minutes, and if the dataset has changed, the report is refreshed. |User selects none, daily, or weekly. Daily can be up to 8 times a day. Weekly is actually a weekly schedule that the user creates and sets refresh for as few as once a week and as often as daily. |Once every hour |
| **How much control does the user have over the subscription email schedule?** |Options are: daily or weekly |No options: users is sent an email if the report refreshes, but no more than once per day. |If the refresh schedule is daily, options are daily and weekly.  If the refresh schedule is weekly only option is weekly. |No options: user is sent an email whenever the dataset is updated, but no more than once per day. |

## Manage your subscriptions
Only the person who created the subscription can manage it.  There are 2 paths to the screen for managing your subscriptions.  The first is by selecting **Manage all subscriptions** from the **Subscribe to emails** dialog (see screenshots below step 4 above). The second is by selecting the Power BI cog icon ![gear icon](./media/end-user-subscribe/power-bi-settings-icon.png) from the top menubar and choosing **Settings**.

![select Settings](./media/end-user-subscribe/power-bi-subscribe-settings.png)

The particular subscriptions displayed will depend on which workspace is currently active.  To see all of your subscriptions at once for all workspaces, be sure that **My Workspace** is active. For help understanding workspaces, see [Workspaces in Power BI](end-user-create-apps.md).

![see all subscriptions in My Workspace](./media/end-user-subscribe/power-bi-subscriptions.png)

A subscription will end if the Pro license expires, the dashboard or report is deleted by the owner, or the user account used to create the subscription is deleted.

## Considerations and troubleshooting
* For dashboard email subscriptions, if any tiles have row level security (RLS) applied, those tiles will not display.  For report email subscriptions, if the dataset uses RLS you will not be able to create a subscription.
* Report page subscriptions are tied to the name of the report page. If you subscribe to a report page, and rename it, you will have to re-create your subscription
* Currently, email subscriptions for reports/dashboards using live connection datasets aren't supported when subscribing users other than yourself.
* For email subscriptions on live connection datasets, you will only get emails when the data changes. So, if a refresh occurs but no data changes, Power BI will not send you an email.
* Email subscriptions do not support most [custom visuals](../power-bi-custom-visuals.md).  The one exception is those custom visuals that have been [certified](../power-bi-custom-visuals-certified.md).  
* Email subscriptions do not support R-powered custom visuals at this time.  
* If any dashboard tiles have row level security (RLS) applied, those tiles will not display.
* You can't subscribe other users to a report that has row level security (RLS) applied.
* Email subscriptions are sent with the report's default filter and slicer states. Any changes to the defaults that you make after subscribing will not show up in the email.    
* E-mail subscriptions are not yet supported on reports pages created by the Power BI Desktop live connect to service feature.    
* For dashboards subscriptions specifically, certain types of tiles are not yet supported.  These include: streaming tiles, video tiles, custom web content tiles.     
* If you share a dashboard with a colleague outside of your tenant, you will not be able to also create a subscription for that colleague. So if you are aaron@xyz.com, you can share with anyone@ABC.com, but you cannot yet subscribe anyone@ABC.com and they cannot subscribe to shared content.      
* Subscriptions may fail on dashboards or reports with extremely large images due to email size limits.    
* Power BI automatically pauses refresh on datasets associated with dashboards and reports that have not been visited in more than 2 months.  However, if you add a subscription to a dashboard or report, it will not be paused even if it goes unvisited.    
* If you are not receiving the subscription emails, ensure that your User Principal Name (UPN) is able to receive emails. [The Power BI team is working on relaxing this requirement](https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Issues/No-Mail-from-Cloud-Service/idc-p/205918#M10163), so stay tuned. 
* If your dashboard or report is in Premium capacity, you can use group email alias for subscriptions, instead of subscribing colleagues one email address at a time. The aliases are based on the current active directory.
