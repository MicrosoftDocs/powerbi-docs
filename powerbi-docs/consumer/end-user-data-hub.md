# Discover data items using the data hub

The data hub helps you find, explore, and use data items in your organization, such as semantic models, datamarts, and their related reports. It provides information about the data items and about reports built using those items. In this way, report consumers can find reports based on trustworthy data.

This article explains what you see on the data hub and describes how to use it. For more details and advanced features available on the data hub, see [Data discovery using the data hub](../connect-data/service-data-hub.md).  

## Find the data you need

The data discovery experience starts on the data hub. To get to the data hub:

- In the Power BI service left navigation pane, select **Data hub**.
- In the Power BI app in Teams, select either the **Data hub** tab or **Data hub** in the navigation pane.

The image shows the OneLake data hub in the Power BI service.

The data hub shows a selection of recommended data items and a list of all the data items in the organization that you have permissions to access. If [semantic model discoverability](../collaborate-share/service-discovery.md) is enabled for your account, you also see a list of semantic models.
