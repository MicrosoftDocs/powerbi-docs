# Install and use the sample Sales and Marketing app in the Power BI service

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-yyny](../includes/consumer-appliesto-yyny.md)]

Now that you have a [basic understanding of how to get Power BI content](end-user-app-view.md), let's use Microsoft AppSource to add the Marketing and Sales template app to Power BI. The Marketing and Sales template app contains sample data that you can use to explore the Power BI service. This particular app has one dashboard and several report pages.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Installing this app from Microsoft AppSource requires that you have a **Power BI Pro** or **Premium Per User** license. For more information, see [licenses](end-user-license.md).

## Get the app from Microsoft AppSource

1. Open [https://appsource.microsoft.com](https://appsource.microsoft.com).

2. In the search box, enter **Microsoft sample** and select **Microsoft sample - Sales & Marketing**.

3. Optionally, read through the overview and reviews, and take a look at the images. Then, select **Get it now** > **Install**.

4. The Power BI service displays a success message once the app is installed. Select **Go to workspace**. Or select the app itself from the **Apps** container.

5. Depending on how the designer created the app, either the app dashboard or app report displays. This template app is set to open to the dashboard.

## Interact with the dashboards and reports in the app

Take some time to explore the data in the dashboard and reports that make up the app. You have access to all of the standard Power BI interactions such as filtering, highlighting, sorting, and drilling down. If you're confused by the difference between dashboards and reports, see the [article about dashboards](end-user-dashboards.md) and the [article about reports](end-user-reports.md).
