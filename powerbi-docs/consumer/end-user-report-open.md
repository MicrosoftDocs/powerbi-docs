# View a report in Power BI service for *consumers*
A report is one or more pages of visuals. Reports are created by Power BI *designers* and [shared with *consumers* directly](end-user-shared-with-me.md) or as part of an [app](end-user-apps.md). 

There are many different ways to open a report and we'll show you two of them: open from Home and open from a dashboard. 

<!-- add art-->


## Open a report from Power BI Home
Let's open a report that's been shared with you directly and then open a report that was shared as part of an app.

   ![Home page](./media/end-user-report-open/power-bi-home.png)

### Open a report that has been shared with you
Power BI *designers* can share a report directly with you. Content that is shared this way shows up in the **Shared with me** container on your nav bar and in the **Shared with me** section of your Home canvas.

1. Open the Power BI service (app.powerbi.com).

2. From the nav bar, select **Home** to display your Home canvas.  

   ![Home canvas](./media/end-user-report-open/power-bi-select-home-new.png)
   
3. Scroll down until you see **Shared with me**. Look for the report icon ![report icon](./media/end-user-report-open/power-bi-report-icon.png). In this screenshot we have one dashboard and one report named *Sales and marketing sample*.

4. Simply select the report *card* to open the report.

   ![report page](./media/end-user-report-open/power-bi-filter-pane.png)

5. Notice the tabs along the left side.  Each tab represents a report *page*. We currently have the *Growth Opportunity* page open. Select the *YTD Category* tab to open that report page instead.

6. Right now we're seeing the entire report page. To change the display (zoom) of the page, select the View dropdown from the upper right corner (**>**) and choose **Actual size**.

### Open a report that is part of an app
If you've received apps from colleagues or from AppSource, those apps are available from Home and from the **Apps** container on your nav bar. An [app](end-user-apps.md) is a bundle of dashboards and reports.

1. Go back to Home by selecting **Home** from the nav bar.

7. Scroll down until you see **My Apps**.

   ![Home page](./media/end-user-report-open/power-bi-my-apps.png)

8. Select one of the apps to open it. Depending on the options set by the app *designer*, the app will open either a dashboard, a report, or an app content list. If selecting the app:
    - opens the report, you're all set.
    - opens a dashboard, see ***Open a report from a dashboard***, below.
    - opens the app content list, under **Reports**, select the report to open it.


## Open a report from a dashboard
Reports can be opened from a dashboard. Most dashboard tiles are *pinned* from reports. Selecting a tile opens the report that was used to create the tile. 

1. From a dashboard, select a tile. In this example we've selected the "Total Units YTD..." column chart tile.

    ![dashboard with tile selected](./media/end-user-report-open/power-bi-dashboard-new.png)

2.  The associated report opens. Notice that we're on the "YTD Category" page. This is the report page that contains the column chart we selected from the dashboard.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all tiles lead to a report. 
>If you select a tile that was [created with Q&A](end-user-q-and-a.md), the Q&A screen will open. 
>If you select a tile that was [created using the dashboard **Add tile** widget](../service-dashboard-add-widget.md), several different things may happen.  


##  Still more ways to open a report
As you get more comfortable navigating the Power BI service, you'll figure out workflows that work best for you. A few other ways to access reports:
- From the nav bar using **Favorites** and **Recent**    
- Using [View related](end-user-related.md)    
- In an email, when someone [shares with you](../service-share-reports.md) or you [set an alert](end-user-alerts.md)    
- From your [Notification center](end-user-notification-center.md)    
- and more

## Next steps
There are [so many ways to interact with a report](end-user-reading-view.md).  Start exploring by selecting each tab to the side of the report canvas.
