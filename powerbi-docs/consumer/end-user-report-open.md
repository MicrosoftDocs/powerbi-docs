# View a report in the Power BI service for *consumers*

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-service-new-look-include](../includes/power-bi-service-new-look-include.md)]

A report is one or more pages of visuals. Reports are created by Power BI *designers* and [shared with *consumers* directly](end-user-shared-with-me.md) or as part of an [app](end-user-apps.md). 

There are many different ways to open a report and we'll show you two of them: open from Home and open from a dashboard.

## Open a report from Power BI Home
Let's open a report that's been shared with you directly and then open a report that was shared as part of an app.

   ![Home page](./media/end-user-report-open/power-bi-home-canvas.png)

### Open a report that has been shared with you
Power BI *designers* can share an individual report directly with you via a link in email or by adding it automatically to your Power BI content. Reports that are shared this way shows up in the **Shared with me** container on your nav pane and in the **Shared with me** section of your Home canvas.

1. Open the Power BI service (app.powerbi.com).

2. From the nav pane, select **Home** to display your Home canvas.  

   ![Home canvas](./media/end-user-report-open/power-bi-select-home-new.png)
   
3. Scroll down until you see **Shared with me**. Look for the report icon ![report icon](./media/end-user-report-open/power-bi-report-icon.png). In this screenshot we have one dashboard and one report. The report is named *Sales and marketing sample*.

4. Simply select the report *card* to open the report.

   ![report page](./media/end-user-report-open/power-bi-open.png)

5. Notice the tabs along the left side.  Each tab represents a report *page*. We currently have the *Growth Opportunity* page open. Select the *YTD Category* tab to open that report page instead. 

   ![report page tabs](./media/end-user-report-open/power-bi-ytd.png)

6. Notice the **Filters** pane along the right side. Filters that have been applied to this report page, or to the entire report, are displayed here.

7. Hovering over a report visual reveals several icons and **More options** (...). To see the filters applied to a specific visual, select the filter icon. Here we've selected the filter icon for the *Total units by rolling period and region* line chart.

   ![report page tabs](./media/end-user-report-open/power-bi-visual-filters.png)

6. Right now we're seeing the entire report page. To change the display (zoom) of the page, select the View dropdown from the upper right corner and choose **Actual size**.

There are many ways for you to interact with a report to discover insights and make business decisions.  Use the table of contents on the left to read through other articles about Power BI reports. 

### Open a report that is part of an app
If you've received apps from colleagues or from AppSource, those apps are available from Home and from the **Apps** container on your nav pane. An [app](end-user-apps.md) is a collection of dashboards and reports that have been bundled together for you by a Power BI *designer*.

### Prerequisites
To follow along, download the Sales and Marketing app.
1. In your browser, navigate to appsource.microsoft.com.
1. Search for "Sales and Marketing" and select **Microsoft sample - Sales & Marketing**.
1. Select **Get it now** > **Continue** > **Install** to install the app in your Apps container. 

You can open the app from your Apps container or from Home.
1. Go back to Home by selecting **Home** from the nav pane.

7. Scroll down until you see **My Apps**.

   ![Home page](./media/end-user-report-open/power-bi-app.png)

8. Select your new *Sales and marketing* app to open it. Depending on the options set by the app *designer*, the app will open either a dashboard or a report. This app opens to a dashboard.  


## Open a report from a dashboard
Reports can be opened from a dashboard. Most dashboard [tiles](end-user-tiles.md) are *pinned* from reports. Selecting a tile opens the report that was used to create the tile. 

1. From the dashboard, select a tile. In this example we've selected the *Total Units YTD...* column chart tile.

    ![dashboard with tile selected](./media/end-user-report-open/power-bi-dashboard.png)

2.  The associated report opens. Notice that we're on the *YTD Category* page. This is the report page that contains the column chart we selected from the dashboard.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all tiles lead to a report. 
>If you select a tile that was [created with Q&A](end-user-q-and-a.md), the Q&A screen will open. 
>If you select a tile that was [created using the dashboard **Add tile** widget](../service-dashboard-add-widget.md), several different things may happen: a video may play, a website open, and more.  


##  Still more ways to open a report
As you get more comfortable navigating the Power BI service, you'll figure out workflows that work best for you. A few other ways to access reports:
- From the nav pane using [Favorites](end-user-favorite.md) and [Recent](end-user-recent.md)    
- Using [View related](end-user-related.md)    
- In an email, when someone [shares with you](../service-share-reports.md) or you [set an alert](end-user-alerts.md)    
- From your [Notification center](end-user-notification-center.md)    
- From a workspace
- and more
