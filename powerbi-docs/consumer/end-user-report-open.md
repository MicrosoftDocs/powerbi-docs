# View a report in Power BI service for *consumers*
A report is one or more pages of visuals. Reports are  created by Power BI *report designers* and [shared with *consumers* directly](end-user-shared-with-me.md) or as part of an [app](end-user-apps.md). 

There are many different ways to open a report and we'll show you two of them: open from the Home page and open from a dashboard. 

<!-- add art-->


## Open a report from your Home page
Let's open a report that's been shared with you directly and then open a report that was shared as part of an app.

   ![Home page](./media/end-user-report-open/power-bi-home.png)

### Open a report that has been shared with you
Power BI *designers* can share a report directly with you by clicking a **Share** button on their top menu bar. Content that is shared this way shows up in the **Shared with me** container on your left nav bar and in the **Shared with me** section of your Home page.

1. Open Power BI service (app.powerbi.com).

2. From the left navigation bar, select **Home (Preview)** to open your Home page.  

   ![Home page](./media/end-user-report-open/power-bi-select-home.png)
   
3. Scroll down until you see **Shared with me**. Look for the report icon ![report icon](./media/end-user-report-open/power-bi-report-icon.png). In this screenshot we have two reports: *Financial* and *Northwind*.

4. Simply select one of the report *cards* to open the report.

   ![report page](./media/end-user-report-open/power-bi-report1.png)

5. Notice the tabs along the bottom. Each tab represents a report *page*. We currently have the *IT Spend Trend* page open. Select a different tab to open that report page. 

   ![report page tabs](./media/end-user-report-open/power-bi-tabs.png)

6. Right now we can only see a portion of the report page. To change the display (zoom) of the page, select **View** > **Fit to page**.

### Open a report that is part of an app
If you've received apps from colleagues or from AppSource, those apps are available from your Home page and from the **Apps** container on your left nav bar. An [app](end-user-apps.md) is a bundle of dashboards and reports.

1. Go back to your Home page by selecting **Home (Preview)** from the left nav bar.

7. Scroll down until you see **My Apps**.

   ![Home page](./media/end-user-report-open/power-bi-my-apps.png)

8. Select one of the apps to open it. Depending on the options set by the app *designer*, the app will open either a dashboard, a report, or an app content list. If selecting the app:
    - opens the report, you're all set.
    - opens a dashboard, see [Open a report from a dashboard](#Open-a-report-from-a-dashboard), below.
    - opens the app content list, under **Reports**, select the report to open it.


## Open a report from a dashboard
Reports can be opened from a dashboard. Most dashboard tiles are *pinned* from reports. Selecting a tile opens the report that was used to create the tile. 

1. From a dashboard, select a tile. In this example we've selected the "Total Units YTD..." column chart tile.

    ![dashboard with tile selected](./media/end-user-report-open/power-bi-dashboard.png)

2.  The associated report opens. Notice that we're on the "YTD Category" page. This is the report page that contains the column chart we selected from the dashboard.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all tiles lead to a report. 
>If you select a tile that was [created with Q&A](end-user-q-and-a.md), the Q&A screen will open. 
>If you select a tile that was [created using the dashboard **Add tile** widget](../service-dashboard-add-widget.md), several different things may happen.  


##  Still more ways to open a report
As you get more comfortable navigating Power BI service, you'll figure out workflows that work best for you. A few other ways to access reports:
- From the left navpane using **Favorites** and **Recent**    
- Using [View related](end-user-related.md)    
- In an email, when someone [shares with you](../service-share-reports.md) or you [set an alert](end-user-alerts.md)    
- From your [Notification center](end-user-notification-center.md)    
- and more

## Next steps
There are [so many ways to interact with a report](end-user-reading-view.md).  Start exploring by selecting each tab at the bottom of the report canvas.
