# Navigate the Power BI service

This article helps you find your way around the **Power BI service** as a business user - someone who views and interacts with reports, dashboards, and apps that others create.

> [!TIP]
> For creation tasks, see [Get started creating in the Power BI service](../fundamentals/service-get-started.md). For interactions like filtering, exporting, and subscriptions, see [Interact with reports and dashboards](end-user-reading-view.md).

## Prerequisites

- [Sign up for Power BI](https://app.powerbi.com/signupredirect?pbi_source=web) if you don't already have an account.
- Familiarity with [Power BI service basics](../fundamentals/service-basic-concepts.md) is helpful but not required.

## Navigation pane

Use the navigation pane on the left to move around the Power BI service. Here's what each item does:

| Navigation item | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Home | Your landing page with recent items, favorites, and recommendations. |
| Browse | Lists of recent, favorite, and shared content. |
| OneLake | Discover semantic models and reusable data. |
| OneLake catalog | Search governed data assets across your organization. |
| Create | Start a new report, semantic model, or other content. Use the Excel or CSV connectors via **Get data** to create refreshable semantic models. The legacy Excel/CSV import experience is being retired; see [Get data from Excel workbook files](../connect-data/service-excel-workbook-files.md) for details. |
| Apps | Access packaged report and dashboard collections. Learn more about [Apps](end-user-apps.md). |
| Workspaces | Team content containers. Learn more about [Workspaces](end-user-workspaces.md). |
| Metrics | Track organizational goals and KPIs. |
| Copilot | AI assistance for insights (if enabled). |
| Learn | Tutorials, samples, and training resources. |

Some items appear only with specific roles or licenses: **Monitor**, **Real-Time**, **Deployment pipelines**, and **Workloads**.

## Key concepts

- **Dashboards** display key visuals from one or more reports on a single page. Learn more about [dashboards](end-user-dashboards.md).
- **Reports** contain multiple pages with detailed visualizations. Learn more about [reports](end-user-reports.md).
- **Apps** are curated collections of dashboards and reports packaged for your team.
