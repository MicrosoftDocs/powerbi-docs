# Search and find content in the Power BI service

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-yyny](../includes/consumer-appliesto-yyny.md)]

The Power BI service includes search and filter tools to help you quickly find dashboards, reports, apps, and other content. When you're new to Power BI, you have only a few pieces of content. But as colleagues share content with you and you download apps, you can end up with long lists. Global search and sorting help you navigate your content efficiently.

## Search for content

You can access search from almost every part of the Power BI service. Just look for the search box or search icon. :::image type="icon" source="./media/end-user-search-sort/power-bi-search-icon.png" border="false":::

In the **Search** field, type all or part of the name of a dashboard, report, workbook, workspace, app, or owner. Power BI searches all of your content.

In some Power BI areas, such as workspaces, you find two different **Search** fields. The **Search** field in the menu bar searches all of your content, while the **Search** field on the workspace canvas searches only that workspace.

> [!NOTE]
> [B2B guest users](../collaborate-share/service-roles-new-workspaces.md) can't use search. If a guest user enters a search term, no results appear. 

## Sort content lists

If you have only a few pieces of content, you don't need to sort them. But when you have long lists of dashboards and reports, sorting helps you find what you need. For example, the **Shared with me** content list in the following image has many items.

:::image type="content" source="./media/end-user-search-sort/power-bi-shared-search.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Shared with me content list displaying multiple items.":::

Currently, this content list is sorted alphabetically by name, from Z to A. To change the sort criteria, select the arrow to the right of **Name**.

:::image type="content" source="./media/end-user-search-sort/power-bi-sort-z-to-a-new.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a content list sorted by the Name column.":::

You can also sort content in workspaces. In this example, the content is sorted by the **Refreshed** date. To set sorting criteria for workspaces, select a column header, and then select it again to change the sorting direction.

:::image type="content" source="./media/end-user-search-sort/power-bi-refreshed.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a content list sorted by the Refreshed date column.":::

Not all columns support sorting. Hover over the column headings to discover which columns you can sort.

## Filter content lists

Another way to quickly find content is to use the content list **Filter**. Display the filters by selecting **Filter** from the upper right corner. The filters available depend on your location in the Power BI service. The following example is from a **Recent** content list. It allows you to filter the list by content **Type**, **Time**, or **Owner**.
