# Visualization interactions in a Power BI report
If you have edit permissions for a report, you can use **Visual interactions** to change how visualizations on a report page impact each other. 

By default, visualizations on a report page can be used to cross-filter and cross-highlight the other visualizations on the page.
For example, selecting a state on a map visualization highlights the column chart and filters the line chart to display only data that applies to that one state.
See [About filtering and highlighting](../power-bi-reports-filters-and-highlighting.md). And if you have a visualization that supports [drilling](end-user-drill.md), by default, drilling one visualization has no impact on the other visualizations on the report page. But both of these default behaviors can be overridden, and interactions set, on a per-visualization basis.

This article shows you how to use **Visual interactions** in Power BI service [Editing view](../service-interact-with-a-report-in-editing-view.md) and in Power BI Desktop. If a report has been shared with you, you will not be able to change the Visual interactions settings.

> [!NOTE]
> The terms *cross-filter* and *cross-highlight* are used to distinguish the behavior described here from what happens when you use the **Filters** pane to filter and highlight visualizations.

1. Select a visualization to make it active.  
2. Display the **Visual Interactions** options.
    - In Power BI service, select the dropdown from the report menubar.

    - In Desktop, select **Format > Interactions**.

3. To turn on the visualization interaction controls, select **Edit interactions**. Power BI adds cross-filter and cross-highlight icons to all of the other visualizations on the report page.

3. Determine what impact the selected visualization should have on the others.  And, optionally, repeat for all other visualizations on the report page.
   
   * If it should cross-filter the visualization, select the **filter** icon ![filter icon](./media/end-user-interactions/pbi-filter-icon-outlined.png).
   * If it should cross-highlight the visualization, select the **highlight** icon ![highlight icon](./media/end-user-interactions/pbi-highlight-icon-outlined.png).
   * If it should have no impact, select the **no impact** icon ![no impact icon](./media/end-user-interactions/pbi-noimpact-icon-outlined.png).

4. To turn on drilling controls, select **Drilling filters other visuals**.  Now when you drill down (and up) in a visualization, the other visualizations on the report page change to reflect your current drilling selection.
