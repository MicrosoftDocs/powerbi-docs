# Interact with visuals in reports, dashboards, and apps

At its most basic, a ***visualization*** (or *visual*), is a type of chart built by Power BI *designers* using the data in reports and datasets. 

Visuals are found on dashboards, in reports, and can be created on-the-fly using Power BI Q&A. When a designer creates a visual in a report, they can *pin* that visual to a dashboard. A [visual on a dashboard is called a *tile*](end-user-tiles.md). This dashboard has eight tiles.

> [!TIP]
> We recommend first reading the overview topic [Power BI basic concepts for *consumers*](end-user-basic-concepts.md) before reading this more-detailed content.

## What can I do with visuals?

Visuals are created by report and dashboard *designers* and shared with *consumers*. As a consumer, you have many options for interacting with visuals to uncover insights and make data-driven business decisions. Most of these options are listed in the table below, with links to step-by-step instructions.

For many of these options, your administrator or the *designer* can disable your ability to see or use these features. And some of these features only work on specific visuals.  If you have any questions, contact your administrator or the owner of the report or dashboard. To find the owner, select the dashboard or report dropdown.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> But first, a word about Q&A. Q&A is Power BI's natural language search tool. You type a question using natural language and Q&A answers the question in the form of a visual. Q&A is a way consumers can create their own visuals. However, the visuals you create with Q&A cannot be saved. But, if there's something specific you want to learn from the data, and the designer didn't include it in a report or on a dashboard, Q&A is a great option. To learn more about Q&A, see [Q&A for consumers](end-user-q-and-a.md).
