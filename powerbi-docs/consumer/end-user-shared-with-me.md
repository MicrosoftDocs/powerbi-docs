# Display the dashboards and reports that have been shared with me

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-yyny](../includes/consumer-appliesto-yyny.md)]


Your colleagues have created  reports, dashboards, scorecards, and datasets. When it comes time to share them with you or to ask for your collaboration, there are several ways to collaborate and share. In this article, we compare the options. 

No matter which option is used, to view content created by others requires a Power BI Pro license, or the content needs to be in a Premium capacity.

Watch Amanda explain the **Shared with me** content list and demonstrate how to navigate and filter the list. Then follow the step-by-step instructions below the video to try it out yourself. For you to view dashboards shared with you, you need to have a Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) license. Read [What is Power BI Premium?](../enterprise/service-premium-gen2-what-is.md) for details.

## Interact with shared content

You'll have options for interacting with the shared dashboards and reports, depending on the permissions the *designer* gives you. These include being able to make copies of the dashboard, subscribe, open the report [in Reading view](end-user-reading-view.md), and reshare with other colleagues. Select a dashboard or report to open it.


## Search and sort shared dashboards and reports
If your **Shared with me** content list gets long, you have several options for finding what you need. Use the search field (1), sort by one of the columns (2), or use the Filters pane. To open the Filters pane, select **Filters** from the upper right corner.
