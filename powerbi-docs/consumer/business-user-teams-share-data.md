# Lead data-driven discussions in Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-ynny](../includes/consumer-appliesto-ynny.md)]

Data helps everyone get on the same page before important decisions. Sharing data with your team is important and easy with Power BI in Microsoft Teams. You can share data in Teams in channels, in chats, and in meetings.

## Share in channels, chats, and meetings

1. Open the channel, chat, or meeting where you’d like to share.
1. Select the **+ Add a tab** button and add the Power BI tab.
1. Pick the Power BI item you’d like to share.
1. Select **Save**.

You can share in channels, meetings, and even in chats.

## Give team members permission

Make sure your team has permission to the report or scorecard by sharing it with them.

1. Open the item in Power BI in Teams, or in the Power BI service, and select **File** > **Manage Permissions**.

    If you don't see this option, you might not have permission to share the item. If you do not, don’t worry. The attendees can request access themselves when they try to view the report.

1. Select **Direct access**.
1. Select **Add user**.
1. Add the names of your colleagues. Decide what permissions you want them to have, whether to send them an email, and select **Grant access**.

## Chat about data with rich links and cards

When discussing data, it’s important that your colleagues can open the underlying data to see and explore trends. This helps them answer questions and understand the full context of requests you’re making. It’s also an easy way to encourage more use of data in decision making. For information on sharing and chatting about Power BI content in Teams, see [Chat in Microsoft Teams directly from the Power BI service](../collaborate-share/service-share-report-teams.md#chat-about-power-bi-content-in-microsoft-teams).

### Send your colleagues links to reports

1. In the Teams channel or chat, start a new conversation.
1. In the command bar for the editor, select **Messaging extensions (...)**.
1. Select **Power BI**.
1. Search for the content you want to share, or select from your list of recent items.
1. Pick a Power BI item.
1. Select **Send**.

    A rich card is added to the conversation, making it easy for anyone to open the item.

    It’s a great way to help without leaving the conversation, and saves everyone time.

## Create rich cards to paste in chat

If you use Power BI in a web browser, it’s easy to send a link to a colleague.

1. Open a report in the Power BI service in the browser, and copy the link.
1. Start a conversation and paste the link.
   Teams automatically creates a rich card.
1. Select **Send**.
1. Your colleague sees a rich card with a link to open the report.
