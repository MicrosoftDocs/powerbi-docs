# View a paginated report in the Power BI service

In this article, you learn about viewing a paginated report to the Power BI service. Paginated reports are reports created in Report Builder and uploaded to any  workspace in a Premium capacity. Look for the diamond icon ![Power BI Premium capacity diamond icon](media/paginated-reports-view-power-bi-service/premium-diamond.png) next to the workspace name. 

Paginated reports have their own icon ![Paginated report icon](media/paginated-reports-view-power-bi-service/power-bi-paginated-report-icon.png).

You can also export paginated reports to a number of formats: 

- Microsoft Excel
- Microsoft Word
- Microsoft PowerPoint
- PDF (and [Accessible PDF, or PDF/UA](../../report-server/rendering-extension-support.md))
- Comma-separated values
- XML
- Web archive (.mhtml)

## View a paginated report
