# Featured dashboards in the Power BI service

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-service-new-look-include](../includes/power-bi-service-new-look-include.md)]

Many of us have one dashboard that we visit more than any others. It might be the dashboard we use to run our business. Or, it might be a dashboard that contains an aggregation of tiles from many different dashboards and reports.

## Create a featured dashboard
When you select a dashboard as *featured*, each time you open the Power BI service, it opens with that dashboard displayed.

You can also select a few dashboards and set them as favorites. See [Dashboard favorites](end-user-favorite.md).

If you haven't set a featured dashboard, Power BI opens to the last dashboard you used or to Power BI **Home**. 

### Set a dashboard as featured

1. Follow the previous steps 1 and 2.

2. Select **Set as featured dashboard**. Unfeaturing a dashboard doesn't remove it from Power BI.

## Remove the featured dashboard
If you decide that you don't want any dashboard to be designated as featured, here's how to unfeature a dashboard.

1. Open the currently featured dashboard.
2. On the top menu bar, select **More options** (...) and select **Disable featured**.
