      - question: |
         What is the Microsoft Power BI service?
        answer: |
          The Power BI service is a cloud-based business analytics service that enables anyone to visualize and analyze data with greater speed, efficiency, and understanding. It connects users to a broad range of cloud-based and on-premises data through easy-to-use dashboards, interactive reports, and compelling visualizations that bring data to life. Read more about [Power BI](../fundamentals/power-bi-overview.md).
          
      - question: |
         What is a Power BI 'business user'?
        answer: |
          The way you interact with Power BI will depend on your job role. As an end user or *business user*, you are the person who receives content (dashboards, reports, and apps) from colleagues. You work in the online or mobile version of Power BI, which is called the Power BI service, reviewing and interacting with this content, to make business decisions.  Read more about [Power BI for business users](index.yml).
          
          
      - question: |
         What's the difference between Power BI Pro and Power BI Premium?
        answer: |
          Power BI Pro is an individual user license that allows access to all content and capabilities in the Power BI service. You can even share content and collaborate with other Pro users. Only Pro users can publish content to other workspaces, share dashboards, and subscribe to dashboards and reports. 
          
          Power BI Premium provides a capacity to deliver more consistent performance. It also supports larger data volumes in Power BI. For individual users, Premium enables widespread distribution of content by Pro users and it doesn't require per-user Pro licenses for recipients viewing the content. This means that *business users* can collaborate with colleagues and view and interact with dashboards, reports, and apps that have been shared with them. 
          
          To learn more, see [What type of license do I have?](end-user-license.md).
          
      - question: |
         What if I have questions about Power BI Premium?
        answer: |
          For questions related to Power BI Premium, see [Power BI Premium FAQ](../enterprise/service-premium-gen2-faq.yml).
          
      - question: |
         What is Power BI Desktop?
        answer: |
          Power BI Desktop is a free application you can install right on your own computer. Power BI Desktop works cohesively with the Power BI service.  Data scientists, report designers, admins, and developers work with Power BI Desktop to produce reports and make them available to the Power BI service *business users*, like you.
