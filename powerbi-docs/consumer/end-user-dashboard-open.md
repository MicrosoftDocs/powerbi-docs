# View a dashboard

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-ynny](../includes/consumer-appliesto-ynny.md)]


Power BI *business users* spend a lot of time viewing dashboards. Dashboards are designed to highlight specific information from the underlying reports and semantic models. And Power BI business users rely on that information for tracking, monitoring, answering questions, testing, and more--in order to make data-driven business decisions.

A Power BI Pro or Premium license is required for both sharing a dashboard and viewing a shared dashboard. [Which license do I have?](end-user-license.md). 

## Open a dashboard

Dashboards can be opened from many locations in the Power BI service. One way to open a dashboard is to select and open a workspace.

If that workspace contains a dashboard, you see the following icon.

Once you identified a dashboard, open it by selecting it and the dashboard fills your Power BI canvas.

On the left navigation pane, view and open dashboards from:

- **Home**
- **Browse**, 
  - **Recent** - if you recently visited a dashboard
  - **Favorites** - if you [set a dashboard as a favorite](end-user-favorite.md)
  - **Shared with me** - if a colleague [shared a dashboard with you](../collaborate-share/end-user-shared-with-me.md)
- **Data hub** - contains content from across your organization
- **Apps** - most apps contain both dashboards and reports
- **Workspaces**, including **My workspace** - if you downloaded any of the [Power BI samples](../create-reports/sample-datasets.md) or other content or if colleagues have shared content with you.
