# View a dashboard

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-ynny](../includes/consumer-appliesto-ynny.md)]


Power BI *business users* spend a lot of time viewing dashboards. Dashboards are designed to highlight specific information from the underlying reports and datasets. And Power BI business users rely on that information for tracking, monitoring, answering questions, testing, and more--in order to make data-driven business decisions.

A Power BI Pro or Premium license is required for both sharing a dashboard and viewing a shared dashboard. [Which license do I have?](end-user-license.md). 

## Open a dashboard

Dashboards can be opened from many locations in the Power BI service. One way to open a dashboard is to select and open a workspace.

If that workspace contains a dashboard, you'll see the following icon.

Once you've identified a dashboard, open it by selecting it and the dashboard will fill your Power BI canvas.

On the navigation pane, you can find dashboards in:

- **Home** 
- **Browse**
  - **Recent** - if you've recently visited a dashboard
  - **Favorites** - if you've [set a dashboard as a favorite](end-user-favorite.md)
  - **Shared with me** - if a colleague has [shared a dashboard with you](end-user-shared-with-me.md)
- **Apps** - most apps contain both dashboards and reports
- **My workspace** - if you've downloaded any of the [Power BI samples](../create-reports/sample-datasets.md)
