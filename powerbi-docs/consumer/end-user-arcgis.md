# Interact with an ArcGIS map in Power BI

This article describes different ways a business user can consume  ArcGIS Maps in the Power BI service. ArcGIS Maps in Power BI is also available on Power BI Desktop and mobile. Once a creator shares an ArcGIS map with you, there are many ways to interact with that map.  For more information, see [Create ArcGIS maps in Power BI](../visuals/power-bi-visualizations-arcgis.md).

ArcGIS for Power BI is a map visualization used to enrich data, reports, and dashboards. ArcGIS for Power BI adds geographic, location, and regional demographic data, smart map themes, and analytic features such as drive time, infographics, and points of interest. Combining authoritative data layers on an ArcGIS for Power BI map with spatial analysis provides more complex insight onto your Power BI data.

For example, you can use ArcGIS for Power BI to provide regional insight into sales figures. The following ArcGIS map shows regional sales by size against a demographic layer of the 2020 Esri Diversity Index. An interactive tooltip for Lancaster County shows total population, household population, and total households for the selected area.

## User consent

Here are some things you should know if this is your first time using ArcGIS for Power BI. ArcGIS Maps for Power BI is provided by [Esri](http://www.esri.com). Your use of ArcGIS Maps for Power BI is subject to Esri's [terms](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=826322) and [privacy policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=826323). Power BI users wanting to use the ArcGIS Maps for Power BI visuals need to accept the consent dialog.

## Interact with an ArcGIS map

The features available depend on whether you're the report designer (person who made the map) or a business user (someone shared an ArcGIS map with you). If you're interacting with an ArcGIS map as a business user, you're more likely to use Reading view to consume ArcGIS Maps in the Power BI serve. Here are the actions available to you:

|Action  |Premium customer (with view permissions)  | Power BI Pro customer  |

## Pin a location

Pin a specific address, place, or point of interest on the map. In this example, we're looking for the Washington Monument.

1. Expand the map tools :::image type="icon" source="media/end-user-arcgis/power-bi-arcgis-map-tool.png"::: and select the Search button :::image type="icon" source="media/end-user-arcgis/power-bi-arcgis-search.png"::: to open the search pane.
1. Type the keywords **Washington Monument** in the search field.
    Keywords can include an address, place, or point of interest. As you type, recent searches or suggestions based on similar keywords appear.
1. From the results list, choose **Washington Monument, 2 15th St NW, Washington DC 20024 USA** and select **Close**. A symbol appears on the map, and the map automatically zooms to the location, pinning it during your session. Pins remain in place on the map only during the current session. You can't save a pinned location with the map.
For more information, see [Pin a location&mdash;ArcGIS for Power BI](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/power-bi/use/pin-locations.htm).

## View, show, or hide layers

As a business user, you can show or hide a layer, change the sequence in which a layer is shown, and zoom to a layer’s data boundaries.  To view your map’s layers, follow these steps:

Expand the map tools :::image type="icon" source="media/end-user-arcgis/power-bi-arcgis-map-tool.png"::: and select the Layers button :::image type="icon" source="media/end-user-arcgis/power-bi-arcgis-layers.png"::: to open the **Layers** pane.

- To hide a layer, select the **Hide** button.
- To show a hidden layer, select the **Show** button :::image type="icon" source="media/end-user-arcgis/power-bi-arcgis-unhide.png":::.
- To change the sequence in which a layer is shown on the map, for example, to display a Demographic reference layer on top of the data layer, drag the reference layer to the top of the list of layers in the **Layers** pane.
- To zoom to the extent of the layer’s data boundaries, select **More options (...)** and select **Zoom to layer**.

     :::image type="content" source="media/end-user-arcgis/power-bi-arcgis-zoom.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Zoom to layer for City.":::

You can also use the **Filters** pane to filter layer content on your ArcGIS for Power BI map based on the available data added by the report designer.

> [!NOTE]
> If you find that you can't perform these tasks, it may be that the report designer has disabled these features. Contact the report designer if you have questions.

For more information about working with layers, visit [Work with map layers&mdash;ArcGIS for Power BI](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/power-bi/use/work-with-map-layers.htm).

## Filter map layers

The **Filters** pane contains data added by the report designer. There are many different ways to filter your map content.

1. Expand the **Filters** pane to the right of the map visualization.

   :::image type="content" source="media/end-user-arcgis/power-bi-arcgis-filters-menu.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Filter pane menu expanded.":::

1. Select fields to filter the map. Use **Basic filtering**, to choose from data shown on the map. Use **Advanced filtering** to narrow content by specific parameters.

    :::image type="content" source="media/end-user-arcgis/power-bi-arcgis-advanced-filter.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Filter menu with Advanced Filtering parameters visible.":::

1. Some filters have value parameters (Boolean) available.

1. When you've selected your filter options, select **Apply filter**.
The map is filtered by your selections.

## Change the basemap

A basemap provides a background, or visual context, for the data in a map. For example, a basemap that shows streets can provide context for address data. As a Power BI business user, there are four basemaps provided: Dark Gray Canvas, Light Gray Canvas, OpenStreetMap, and Streets.
> [!NOTE]
> For access to basemaps, the report designer must make them available when designing the report. If the basemaps are unavailable, you will not see the **Basemap** button in the Map tools.

To change the basemap, follow these steps:

1. Expand the map tools :::image type="icon" source="media/end-user-arcgis/power-bi-arcgis-map-tool.png"::: and select the **Basemap** button :::image type="icon" source="media/end-user-arcgis/power-bi-arcgis-basemap.png"::: to display the gallery of available basemaps.
1. Select the **Dark Gray Canvas** basemap.

    :::image type="content" source="media/end-user-arcgis/power-bi-arcgis-change-basemap.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the available basemaps with the Dark Gray Canvas basemap selected and applied.":::

1. The map updates to the new basemap. For more information, see [Change the basemap&mdash;ArcGIS for Power BI](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/power-bi/use/change-the-basemap.htm).

## Select Analysis tools

This tool option appears only if the report designer includes data to perform a Find Similar analysis. For more information on the features of the Analysis tools, see [Create ArcGIS in Power BI](../visuals/power-bi-visualizations-arcgis.md).

:::image type="content" source="media/end-user-arcgis/power-bi-arcgis-analysis-tools.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Map tool menu with the Analysis tools feature expanded.":::

:::image type="icon" source="media/end-user-arcgis/power-bi-arcgis-infographics-tool.png "::: **Infographics**. With this tool, you can provide interactive cards with specific details about the areas on the map.

:::image type="icon" source="media/end-user-arcgis/power-bi-arcgis-reference-layer-tool.png "::: **Reference Layer**. With this tool, you can add a demographic layer to help contextualize your data from Power BI or add a reference layer from ArcGIS to enrich your data.

:::image type="icon" source="media/end-user-arcgis/power-bi-arcgis-buffer-tool.png "::: **Buffer/Drive time**. With this tool, you can find locations on your map within a specific distance, or ring buffer, of the point of origin.

:::image type="icon" source="media/end-user-arcgis/power-bi-arcgis-find-similar-tool.png "::: **Find similar**. With this tool, you can quickly identify locations with attributes comparable to those locations currently selected on the map.

For more information about credits, see [Understand credits](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/administer/credits.htm)  |

*In mobile environments, you can view maps created using the ArcGIS for Power BI visualization included with Power BI (Standard account). Maps that contain premium content from ArcGIS aren't supported in mobile environments.

In services or applications for which ArcGIS for Power BI isn't available, ArcGIS visualizations will show as an empty visual with the Power BI logo.

**How do ArcGIS Maps for Power BI work together?**  
ArcGIS Maps for Power BI is provided by [Esri](https://www.esri.com). When you provide your consent, any data you use that is connected to the map visualization is sent to Esri’s services for geocoding. This means that location information is transformed into latitude and longitude coordinates that can be represented on a map. Through ArcGIS for Power BI, Esri provides services to enrich your data. These include basemaps, spatial analytics, location services, demographic data, and other authoritative data layers. ArcGIS for Power BI interacts with Power BI using an SSL connection protected by a certificate provided and maintained by Esri. For more information about ArcGIS Maps for Power BI, see [Esri's ArcGIS Map for Power BI product page](https://www.esri.com/powerbi).

**What is an ArcGIS account?**</br>
Esri offers an Esri [ArcGIS account](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-for-power-bi/buy) through ArcGIS for Power BI. Adding an ArcGIS account to Power BI can greatly enhance your mapping visualization capabilities by adding an extensive library of data reference layers and geo enrichment.

:::image type="content" source="media/end-user-arcgis/power-bi-arcgis-sign-up.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Map tool menu with the sign-up screen feature open.":::

Power BI doesn't send personal information about you to Esri. This is a separate relationship with a third-party vendor. Once you add ArcGIS account content to your ArcGIS for Power BI visualization, you'll have access to all the Esri content and data associated with your account, role, and organization. Any other Power BI user with whom you share that data&dash;whether within your organization or the public&dash;might also need an ArcGIS account to view shared, potentially licensed content. For details about account types and data limitations, see [ArcGIS for Power BI online help](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/power-bi/get-started/account-types.htm).

For technical or detailed questions about ArcGIS for Power BI, see [ArcGIS for Power BI get started](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/power-bi/get-started/about-maps-for-power-bi.htm) or reach out to [Esri Technical Support](https://www.esri.com/contact#c=us&t=5).

The following table compares the standard features available to all Power BI users to those features available to users signed in to a valid, licensed ArcGIS account.

|Feature  |Standard, included with Power BI  |Requires ArcGIS account  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Basemaps     |     Four basic basemaps    |    All Esri basemaps, access to your organization's basemaps, custom basemaps.     |
|Geocoding     |   3,500 locations per map, 10,000 locations per month      |   10,000 locations per map, no monthly limit     |
|Reference layers     |     10 curated reference layers that contain U.S. demographic data and publicly shared feature layers in ArcGIS    |   Access to all global web maps and layers as defined by your ArcGIS organization or account. This includes access to ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World maps and layers (feature services) and publicly shared feature layers in ArcGIS.     |
|Infographics     |   A curated gallery of U.S. demographic data variables, a maximum of two variables, support for drive time and radius settings      |   Access to all global demographic data variables as defined by your ArcGIS organization or account. This includes access to the ArcGIS GeoEnrichment data browser, a maximum of five variables, and support for all distance and travel settings.     |

**The ArcGIS map is not showing up**</br>
In services or applications where ArcGIS Maps for Power BI isn't available, the visualization will show as an empty visual with the Power BI logo.

**I'm not seeing all of my information on the map**</br>
When geocoding latitude and longitude on the map, up to 30,000 data points are displayed. When geocoding data points such as zip codes or street addresses, only the first 15,000 data points are geocoded. Geocoding place names or countries/regions aren't subject to the 15,000 address limit.

**Is there any charge for using ArcGIS Map for Power BI?**</br>
ArcGIS Maps for Power BI is available to all Power BI users at no extra cost. It's a component provided by **Esri**, and your use is subject to the terms and privacy policy provided by **Esri**, as noted earlier in this article.  If you sign up for an [Esri ArcGIS account](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/power-bi/use/sign-in-to-arcgis.htm), there are [costs associated](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/power-bi/get-started/account-types.htm).

**I'm getting an error message about my cache being full**</br>
This is a bug that is being addressed.  In the meantime, select the link in the error message for instructions on clearing your Power BI cache.

**Can I view my ArcGIS maps offline?**</br>
