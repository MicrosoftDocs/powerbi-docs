# Use Explore (preview) in the Power BI service

> [!NOTE]
> The Explore feature in the Power BI service is currently in preview.

Explore in the Power BI service is a new experience that allows you to explore your data in a focused way. It's designed to be easy to use, so you can quickly get the answers you need without having to be a Power BI expert. You can use Explore on an existing visual to dig into the underlying data, or you can start with a blank canvas and pull in the data you want to explore.

A few scenarios when you could benefit from Explore include:

- You want to see the underlying data behind a visual in a report or a Copilot-generated visual.
- You want to explore a new semantic model (dataset) to learn about it.
- You want to create a new visual or matrix from scratch, but you don't want to create a report.
- You want to explore a subset of data from a datamart query result.
- You want to explore a semantic model that you don't have permission to edit, but you want to create a new visual or matrix from it.

Follow the steps in this article to learn how to use Explore to build a matrix or visual, customize your Exploration, and then save it to a workspace or as a report to share with others.

## Step 1. Navigate to the Explore experience

> [!NOTE]
> You can explore data from any supported Fabric artifact where you have **View** permission on the data, unless restricted by your tenant admin. If restricted, you can only use artifacts where you have **Build** permission. *Exception: ***Build*** permission is always required for Lake Houses.*

You can start your experience with Explore from various entry points:

- **Visual in a report**:
   1. Select **...** for more options.
   1. Select **Explore this data**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/explore-data-service/from-visual-in-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing exploring data from a visual in a report." lightbox="media/explore-data-service/from-visual-in-report.png":::

- **Visual generated by Copilot**:
   1. Select the **Explore this visual button**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/explore-data-service/from-visual-by-copilot.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing exploring data from a visual generated by Copilot." lightbox="media/explore-data-service/from-visual-by-copilot.png":::

- **Artifact**:

  - **From a list**:
     1. Select **...** for more options.
     1. Then select **Explore this data**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/explore-data-service/from-artifact-in-list.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing exploring data from an artifact in a list." lightbox="media/explore-data-service/from-artifact-in-list.png":::

  - **From a report**:
     1. Select **Explore this data**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/explore-data-service/explore-data-report-menu-bar.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Explore this data option on the menu bar.":::

  - **From a datamart**:
     1. Select **Explore this data**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/explore-data-service/sql-query-explore-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Explore this data for a SQL query.":::

- **Workspace**:
   1. Select the **New** button at the top of a workspace.
   1. Then select **Exploration**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/explore-data-service/more-options-explore-data-b.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the New button expanding to show the Exploration option.":::

- **Data hub**:
   1. From the **Discover business insights** action card on the **Details** page, select the **Explore this data** button.

   :::image type="content" source="media/explore-data-service/discover-business-insights.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Explore this data to discover business insights.":::

## Step 2. Build your matrix or visual with Explore (preview)

Regardless of your starting point in Step 1, when you launch the Explore experience, you land in the new focused view. Your data appears in the data pane, and you can edit, drag and drop, or select fields to start building a matrix or visual.

### Matrix and visual fields

*If you start from a visual*, you see that visual on this page. Get a matrix of the underlying data by expanding the **Matrix** section.

:::image type="content" source="media/explore-data-service/build-matrix-or-visual.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing exploring data by building a matrix or visual." lightbox="media/explore-data-service/build-matrix-or-visual.png":::

*If you didn't start from a visual*, you see a blank canvas with matrix and visual fields. You can drag and drop fields from the data pane to the matrix or visual, or select other fields to add.

:::image type="content" source="media/explore-data-service/begin-Exploration.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Explore window opened." lightbox="media/explore-data-service/begin-Exploration.png":::  

The matrix and visual are linked. So as you add fields, sort, and drill into to one, the other one is updated automatically, as long as the visual can accurately reflect the sort or drill state.

For example, you might have a visual with a date hierarchy and you want to drill down to quarters. When you drill down on the visual, the matrix updates accordingly.

:::image type="content" source="media/explore-data-service/drill-down-next-level.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing drilling down to the next level in the chart." lightbox="media/explore-data-service/drill-down-next-level.png":::

> [!NOTE]
> Some interactions between the matrix and visual aren't currently supported. For example, if you drill down on a visual, the matrix might not update to reflect the drill state. The matrix and visual are linked, but if you notice that your visual doesn't reflect the drill state you applied to your matrix, it means that the interaction isn't currently supported.

#### Visual types

You can also change the type of visual, like stacked bar chart, pie chart, or funnel, by using the options in the visual type gallery. If you don't choose a visual type, Explore autoselects the type that best suits your selected data. To turn off this autoselection, deselect the **lightning bolt** icon.

:::image type="content" source="media/explore-data-service/visual-types.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the menu of choices to change visual types." lightbox="media/explore-data-service/visual-types.png":::

### Data pane

Use the **Choose data** section to add or remove data from your Exploration.

Use the **Rearrange data** section of the data pane to make adjustments. Drag and drop fields from the **Choose data** section to the **Rows**, **Columns**, and **Values** wells, or use the **+ Add data** button. You only see the field wells for the outlined selection (that is, the matrix or the visual). Select the other side to see its field wells.

> [!NOTE]
> Some users might see the data pane on the left as we experiment with placement to optimize the experience.

### Layout options

Switch between a horizontal or vertical orientation by using the **Split view horizontally** and **Split view vertically** buttons along the top.  

:::image type="content" source="media/explore-data-service/change-layout-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing switching the layout to side by side." lightbox="media/explore-data-service/change-layout-view.png":::

## Step 3. Add calculations to your Exploration

You can add [visual calculations](../transform-model/desktop-visual-calculations-overview.md) to your visuals. Select the **New visual calculation** button on any 
visual to enter visual calculations edit mode.

:::image type="content" source="media/explore-data-service/add-visual-calculation.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the New visual calculation button." lightbox="media/explore-data-service/add-visual-calculation.png":::

Here, enter the calculation or use the provided [templates](../transform-model/desktop-visual-calculations-overview.md#using-templates).

:::image type="content" source="media/explore-data-service/add-visual-calculation-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the visual calculations edit mode. The templates menu is opened" lightbox="media/explore-data-service/add-visual-calculation-1.png":::

For example, to calculate a running sum of visits, use the **Running sum** template:

:::image type="content" source="media/explore-data-service/add-visual-calculation-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the visual calculations edit mode. The back button is selected" lightbox="media/explore-data-service/add-visual-calculation-2.png":::
> [!NOTE]
> In this view, you can [hide fields](../transform-model/desktop-visual-calculations-overview.md#hiding-fields-from-the-visual) as well using the **Rearrange data** menu.

Once you have added your calculations, select **Back** to go back to your Exploration.

:::image type="content" source="media/explore-data-service/add-visual-calculation-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the visual calculations edit mode. The back button is selected" lightbox="media/explore-data-service/add-visual-calculation-3.png":::

Your calculation is shown on both visuals, unless it can't be displayed on the other visual.

:::image type="content" source="media/explore-data-service/add-visual-calculation-4.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing an Exploration with a visual calculation applied to both visuals" lightbox="media/explore-data-service/add-visual-calculation-4.png":::

## Step 4. Apply filters to your Exploration

As you build out your Exploration, you can also filter your data. Select the **Add filter** button on the top left to quickly add filters on the fields already in your visual or pick from any fields in your semantic model in the **All data** section.  

:::image type="content" source="media/explore-data-service/add-new-filter-trip-purpose-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing adding a new filter for trip purpose." lightbox="media/explore-data-service/add-new-filter-trip-purpose-1.png":::

In this Exploration experience, the filters are added as pills at the top of view, so you can clearly see what the current filter state is and modify it.  

:::image type="content" source="media/explore-data-service/apply-filter-trip-purpose-honeymoon-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing applying the trip purpose filter." lightbox="media/explore-data-service/apply-filter-trip-purpose-honeymoon-2.png":::

## Step 5. Save your Exploration

Save your Exploration to a workspace or as a report.

- **Save to a workspace**:
   1. Select the **Save** button in the upper-left corner. A dialog box appears.
   1. Name the Exploration, pick a workspace to save it to, and add a sensitivity label, if applicable. This also saves your current canvas layout (horizontal or vertical) of the Exploration.

   :::image type="content" source="media/explore-data-service/save-Exploration.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing naming the Exploration and adding it to a workspace." lightbox="media/explore-data-service/save-Exploration.png":::

- **Save as a report**:
   1. Select **Save**.
   1. Select **Save as report**. This saves your Exploration as a one-page report matching the layout on the screen.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You need **Build** permission on the underlying semantic model to save as a report.

## Step 6. Share your Exploration with others

If you want to share your Exploration with others, follow these steps:

1. Select the **Share** button in the upper-right corner.
1. Select the people who can view your Exploration, such as **People in your organization can view**, **People with existing access**, or **Specific people**.
1. Choose more permissions such as **share** or **edit**.
1. Add your recipients' email addresses and an optional message.
1. Select **Send**. You can send via email or Teams, or select **Copy link** to share it on your own.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should be immediately prompted to share the underlying semantic model so the recipients can view the contents of your Exploration. If you're not prompted, you can manually [share the semantic model](../connect-data/service-datasets-share.md) with read permissions. For reports, sharing the underlying semantic model is done automatically.

## Permissions, requirements, and limitations

To fully benefit from Explore in the Power BI service, be aware of the following permissions, requirements, and limitations.

### Permissions and requirements

Explore requires the following permissions and considerations:

- **Accessing Explore (preview)**:
  - By default, people with **View** permissions on the data can access Explore (preview).
  - Admins can limit the experience to people with **Build** permissions if they choose by disabling the **Users with view permission can launch Explore** setting in the admin portal.
  - Exception: For Lake Houses, **Build** permissions are always required.

    :::image type="content" source="media/explore-data-service/disable-launch-explore.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how admins can limit to people with build permissions in the admin portal." lightbox="media/explore-data-service/disable-launch-explore.png":::

  - Semantic model owners can also limit exploration of their models to people with **Build** permissions on an artifact-by-artifact basis. They can do this by disabling the **Allow users with view permissions** setting in the **Explore** section of semantic model settings.

    :::image type="content" source="media/explore-data-service/disable-users-view-permissions.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how admins can limit to people with build permissions in the Explorations section." lightbox="media/explore-data-service/disable-users-view-permissions.png":::

- **Saving an Exploration to a workspace**:
  - Changing a sensitivity label on a semantic model doesn't currently propagate down to the Exploration that you create for it.
  - If you save to **My workspace**, you might need to refresh your page to see the newly saved Exploration artifact.
- **Saving an Exploration as a report**:
  - You need **Build** permissions on the underlying semantic model.
- **Sharing an Exploration**:
  - You need a Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) license.
  - You need to grant **View** permissions to the underlying semantic model so your recipients can view the Exploration.
    - If you skip this step, your recipients have to request permissions to view the Exploration.
  - Explorations aren't currently shown in lineage view as related to the semantic model.

### Limitations

Explore has some limitations. Here are some important things to keep in mind.

- It's not supported in the Power BI mobile app
- There's no entry point from artifacts in the list view of semantic models and reports on the Power BI service Home
- Custom visuals aren't supported
- The following native visuals aren't supported:
  - Matrix
  - Slicers
  - Q&A
  - Smart narratives
  - Metrics
  - Paginated reports
  - Power Apps
  - Power Automate
- It doesn't currently support streaming datasets
- There's a known issue when you attempt to save an Exploration from the Datamart SQL editor entry point
