# Connect to the services you use with Power BI

After you install the app, you can view the dashboard and reports in the Power BI service ([https://powerbi.com](https://powerbi.com)), and in the Power BI mobile apps.

## Get started
[!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-apps-get-more-apps](.././includes/powerbi-service-apps-get-more-apps.md)]

## View the dashboard and reports
When the import is complete, the new app appears on the Apps page.

1. Select **Apps** in the left navigation pane > select the app.

2. You can ask a question by typing in the Q&A box, or click a tile to open the underlying report.

    You can filter and highlight the data in the report, but you can't save your changes.

## What's included
After connecting to a service, you see a newly created app with a dashboard, reports, and dataset. The data from the service is focused on a specific scenario and may not include all the information from the service. The data is scheduled to refresh automatically once per day. You can control the schedule by selecting the dataset.

For more details on connecting to specific services, please refer to the individual help pages.

## Troubleshooting
**Empty tiles**  
While Power BI is first connecting to the service, you may see an empty set of tiles on your dashboard. If you still see an empty dashboard after 2 hours, it's likely the connection failed. If you didn't see an error message with information on correcting the issue, please file a support ticket.

* Select the question mark icon (**?**) in the upper-right corner >  **Get help**.

**Missing information**  
The dashboard and reports include content from the service focused on a specific scenario and do not include all the information from the service. If there's a specific metric that you're not seeing in the content pack, please add an idea on the [Power BI Support](https://support.powerbi.com/forums/265200-power-bi) page.
