# Printing from Power BI service
Print an entire dashboard, a dashboard tile, a report page, or a report visual from Power BI service. Reports can only be printed one page at a time -- you can't print the entire report at once.

> [!NOTE]
> Printing is only available in Power BI service and not Power BI Desktop.

## Considerations and troubleshooting
* Q: I cannot find the **Print** button.    
* A: If you are using Power BI Desktop, printing is not supported.  Printing only works in Power BI service.
* Q: I cannot print all the report pages at once.    
* A: That is correct. Report pages can only be printed one page at a time.
* Q: I cannot print to PDF.    
* A: You will only see this option if you've already configured the PDF driver in your browser.    
* Q: What I see when I select **Print** doesn't match what you're showing me here.    
* A: The Print screens vary by browser and software version.
* Q: My printout isn't scaled correctly.  My dashboard doesn't fit on the page. Other scaling and orientation questions.    
* A: We cannot guarantee that the printed copy will be exactly the same as it appears in Power BI service. Things like scaling, margins, visual details, orientation, and size are not controlled by Power BI. For help with issues like this, refer to the documentation for your specific browser.
