# Connect to Google Analytics with Power BI
Connecting to Google Analytics through Power BI starts by connecting to your Google Analytics account. You will get a Power BI dashboard and a set of Power BI reports that provide insights about your site traffic and user dimensions. You can interact with the dashboard and reports, but you can't save changes. The data will be refreshed automatically once per day.

Connect to [Google Analytics](https://app.powerbi.com/getdata/services/google-analytics) for Power BI. Read more about the [Google Analytics integration](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/integrations/google-analytics) with Power BI.

You can create customized dashboards and reports by starting from the [Google Analytics connector](service-google-analytics-connector.md) in Power BI Desktop. Just connect with your Google Analytics account and create your custom reports, which you can publish to the Power BI service.

## How to connect
[!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-apps-get-more-apps](./includes/powerbi-service-apps-get-more-apps.md)]

1. Select **Google Analytics** \> **Get**.

## System requirements
To connect from Power BI, you need to have a [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) account. Other Google accounts that do not have a Google Analytics account connected to it will see an authentication error.

## Troubleshooting
**Credentials**
If you have multiple Google accounts, please use an incognito or an in-private broswer window during connection to ensure the correct account is used.

If you're getting an error indicating your credentials are invalid however you were able to sign into Google, please confirm you have a [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) account.

**Parameters**
Unique names are currently required for the parameters. If you see an error indicating the value you selected is duplicated, please select another value or change the names in Google Analytics to make them unique. We're actively working to improve this.

>[!NOTE]
>Parameters are case-sensitive. Enter them exactly as they appear in your Google Analytics account.
