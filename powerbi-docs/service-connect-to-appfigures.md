# Connect to appFigures with Power BI
Tracking important statistics about your apps is easy with Power BI and the appFigures content pack. Power BI retrieves your data, including app sales, downloads, and ad statistics, then builds a default dashboard and related reports based on that data.

[!INCLUDE [include-short-name](./includes/service-deprecate-content-packs.md)]

Connect to the [appFigures content pack](https://app.powerbi.com/getdata/services/appfigures) or read more about the [appFigures integration](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/integrations/appfigures) with Power BI.

## How to connect
1. Select **Get Data** at the bottom of the nav pane.

4. For **Authentication Method**, select **oAuth2** \> **Sign In**. When prompted, enter your appFigures credentials and follow the appFigures authentication process.
   
   The first time you connect, Power BI prompts you to allow read-only access to your account. Select **Allow** to begin the import process. This can take a few minutes depending on the volume of data in your account.

5. After Power BI imports the data you will see a new dashboard, report, and dataset in the nav pane. New items are marked with a yellow asterisk \*:

| Dates |This table contains dates from today back to the earliest PublishDate of apps that are Active and Visible in your appFigures account. |
| Events |This table contains download, sales, and ad information for each app, by country, on a daily basis. Note that both app and in-app purchase information is all in this single tableâ€”you can use the <strong>Type</strong> column to differentiate. |
