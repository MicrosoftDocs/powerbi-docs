# Interact with a report in Editing View in Power BI
In report [Editing View](service-reading-view-and-editing-view.md), you have lots of flexibility in exploring and designing a report. All the [Reading View](service-interact-with-a-report-in-reading-view.md) functionality is available -- plus lots more.

## Functionality only available in Editing view
Take a look at the list of topics under the **Reports** header in the Table of Contents. It's a long list and many of the topics cover functionality *only available if you have editing permissions for a report*.  To help you navigate the Table of Contents, Editing View is required for the following:

* Creating, editing, renaming, sharing, and deleting reports.
* Adding, renaming, rearranging, and deleting report pages.
* Formatting reports.
* Adding visualizations, text boxes, and shapes to a report.
* Adding visual-level, page-level, and report-level filters and setting visual interactions.
* Creating refresh schedules.
