# Power BI URLs for whitelisting

**The Power BI online service**, also known as the Power BI SaaS (Software as a Service) application, requires connectivity to the internet. The endpoints below should be reachable for customers using the Power BI online service.

To use the Power BI online service, you must have access to connect to the endpoints marked **required** in the tables below, and any endpoints marked **required** on the linked sites. If the link to an external site refers to a specific section, you only need to review the endpoints in that section.

Endpoints marked **optional** may also be **whitelisted** for specific functionality to work.

The Power BI online service requires only TCP Port 443 to be opened for the listed endpoints.

Wildcards (*) represent all levels under the root domain, and we use N/A when information isn't available. The **Destination(s)** column is a list with FQDN/domains and links to external sites, which contain further endpoint information.

>[!Important]
>The information in the tables below doesn't represent the **U.S. Government cloud**, **the Germany cloud**, or **the China cloud**.
