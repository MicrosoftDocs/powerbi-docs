# Q&A in Power BI
Sometimes the fastest way to get an answer from your data is to ask a question using natural language. For example, "what were total sales last year."  Use Q&A to explore your data using intuitive, natural language capabilities and receive answers in the form of charts and graphs. Q&A is different from a search engine -- Q&A only provides results about the data in Power BI.

> [!NOTE]
> Q&A is also available in the [Microsoft Power BI app for iOS on iPads, iPhones, and iPod Touch devices](mobile-apps-ios-qna.md).

Asking the question is just the beginning.  Have fun traveling through your data refining or expanding your question, uncovering trust-worthy new information, zeroing in on details and zooming out for a broader view. You’ll be delighted by the insights and discoveries you make.

The experience is truly interactive…and fast! Powered by an in-memory storage, response is almost instantaneous.
