# Collaborate in a classic workspace
Power BI workspaces are great places to collaborate with your colleagues on dashboards, reports, and datasets to create *apps*. This article is about the original, *classic* workspaces.  

Collaboration doesn’t end with workspaces in Power BI. When you create one of the classic workspaces in Power BI, you're automatically creating an Office 365 group in the background. Office 365 offers other group services, such as sharing files on OneDrive for Business, conversations in Exchange, shared calendar and tasks, and so on. Read more about [groups in Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/Create-a-group-in-Office-365-7124dc4c-1de9-40d4-b096-e8add19209e9).

> [!NOTE]
> The new workspace experience changes the relationship between Power BI workspaces and Office 365 groups. When you create one of the new workspaces in Power BI, you no longer automatically create an Office 365 group in the background. For more information, see [Create the new workspaces in Power BI](service-create-the-new-workspaces.md).

You need a [Power BI Pro license](service-features-license-type.md) to create a workspace.

## Collaborate on Power BI Desktop files in a workspace
After you create a Power BI Desktop file, you can publish it to a workspace so everyone in the workspace can collaborate on it.

1. In Power BI Desktop, select **Publish** on the **Home** ribbon, then select the workspace in the **Select a destination** box.
   
    ![Publish icon](media/service-collaborate-power-bi-workspace/power-bi-group-publish-pbix.png)
2. In the Power BI service, select the arrow next to **Workspaces** > select the workspace.
   
    ![Workspaces](media/service-collaborate-power-bi-workspace/power-bi-workspace-nav-arrow.png)
3. Select the **Reports** tab, then choose your report.
   
    ![Reports tab](media/service-collaborate-power-bi-workspace/power-bi-workspace-report.png)
   
    From here, it's like any other report in Power BI. You and others in the workspace can modify the report and save tiles to a dashboard of your choosing.

## Collaborate in Office 365
Collaborating in Office 365 starts from the classic workspace in Power BI.

1. In the Power BI service, select the arrow next to **Workspaces** > select **More options** (...) next to your workspace name. 
   
   ![Workspaces menu](media/service-collaborate-power-bi-workspace/power-bi-app-ellipsis.png)
2. From this menu, you can collaborate with your group in a few ways: 
   
   * Have a [group conversation in Office 365](#have-a-group-conversation-in-office-365).
   * [Schedule an event](#schedule-an-event-on-the-group-workspace-calendar) on the group workspace calendar.
   
   The first time you go to your group workspace in Office 365, it may take some time. Give it 15 to 30 minutes, then refresh your browser.

## Have a group conversation in Office 365
1. Select **More options** (...) next to your workspace name \> **Conversations**. 
   
    ![Conversations tab](media/service-collaborate-power-bi-workspace/power-bi-app-ellipsis.png)
   
   The email and conversation site for your group workspace opens in Outlook for Office 365.
