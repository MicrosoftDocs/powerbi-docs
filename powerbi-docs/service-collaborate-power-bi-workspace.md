# Collaborate in your Power BI app workspace
Power BI app workspaces are great places to collaborate with your colleagues on dashboards, reports, and datasets to create *apps*. Collaboration doesn’t end with workspaces in Power BI. Office 365 offers other group services such as sharing files on OneDrive for Business, conversations in Exchange, shared calendar and tasks, and so on. Read more about [groups in Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/Create-a-group-in-Office-365-7124dc4c-1de9-40d4-b096-e8add19209e9).

> [!NOTE]
> The new workspace experience preview will change the relationship between Power BI workspaces and Office 365 groups. You won't automatically be creating an Office 365 group every time you create one of the new workspaces. Read about [creating the new workspaces (preview)](service-create-the-new-workspaces.md)

App workspaces are only available with [Power BI Pro](service-free-vs-pro.md).

## Collaborate on Power BI Desktop files in your app workspace
After you create a Power BI Desktop file, if you publish it to your Power BI app workspace, then everyone in your workspace can collaborate on it.

1. In Power BI Desktop, select **Publish** on the **Home** ribbon, then in the **Select a destination** box, select your app workspace.

2. In the Power BI service, select the arrow next to Workspaces > select your app workspace.
   
    ![App workspaces](media/service-collaborate-power-bi-workspace/power-bi-workspace-nav-arrow.png)
3. Select the Reports tab, then select your report.
   
    ![Reports tab](media/service-collaborate-power-bi-workspace/power-bi-workspace-report.png)
   
    From here, it's like any other report in Power BI. You and others in your app workspace can [modify the report](consumer/end-user-reports.md) and save tiles to a dashboard of your choosing.

## Collaborate in Office 365
Collaborating in Office 365 starts from the app workspace in Power BI.

1. In the Power BI service, select the arrow next to Workspaces > select the ellipsis (**…**) next to your workspace name. 
   
   ![Workspaces menu](media/service-collaborate-power-bi-workspace/power-bi-app-ellipsis.png)
2. From this menu, you can collaborate with your group in a few ways: 
   
   * Have a [group conversation in Office 365](service-collaborate-power-bi-workspace.md#have-a-group-conversation-in-office-365).
   * [Schedule an event](service-collaborate-power-bi-workspace.md#schedule-an-event-on-the-group-workspace-calendar) on the app's group workspace calendar.
   
   The first time you go to your app's group workspace in Office 365, it may take some time. Give it 15 to 30 minutes, then refresh your browser.

## Have a group conversation in Office 365
1. Select the ellipsis (…) next to your app workspace name \> **Conversations**. 
   
    ![Conversations tab](media/service-collaborate-power-bi-workspace/power-bi-app-ellipsis.png)
   
   The email and conversation site for your app's group workspace opens in Outlook for Office 365.

## Schedule an event on the app's group workspace calendar
1. Select the ellipsis (**…**) next to your app workspace name \> **Calendar**. 
   
   ![Calendar tab](media/service-collaborate-power-bi-workspace/power-bi-app-ellipsis.png)
   
   This opens the calendar for your app's group workspace in Outlook for Office 365.
