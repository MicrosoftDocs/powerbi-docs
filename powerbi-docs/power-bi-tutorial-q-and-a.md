# Tutorial: How to use Q&A to create visualizations and build reports
The [Q&A overview](consumer/end-user-q-and-a.md) introduced you to Power BI Q&A and made the distinction between *consumers* (have dashboards and reports shared with them) and *creators* (own the underlying reports and datasets). The first part of this tutorial is designed primarily for people consuming dashboards using Power BI service. And the second part is designed for people creating reports using either Power BI service or Power BI Desktop. [Q&A and Power BI mobile](consumer/mobile/mobile-apps-ios-qna.md) and [Q&A with Power BI Embedded](developer/qanda.md) are covered in separate articles.

Q&A is interactive and even fun, and, more often than not, one question will lead to many others as the visualizations reveal interesting paths to pursue. Watch Amanda demonstrate using Q&A to create visualizations, dig into those visuals, and pin them to dashboards.

## Part 1: Use Q&A on a dashboard in Power BI service (app.powerbi.com)
A dashboard contains tiles pinned from one or more datasets, so you can ask questions about any of the data contained in any of those datasets. To see what reports and datasets were used to create the dashboard, select **View related** from the menubar.

The Q&A question box is located in the upper-left corner of your dashboard, and this is where you type your question using natural language. Q&A recognizes the words you type and figures out where (which dataset) to find the answer. Q&A also helps you form your question with auto-completion, restatement, and other textual and visual aids.

![](media/power-bi-tutorial-q-and-a/powerbi-qna.png)

The answer to your question is displayed as an interactive visualization and updates as you modify the question.

1. Open a dashboard and place your cursor in the question box. Even before you start typing, Q&A displays a new screen with suggestions to help you form your question. You'll see the names of the tables in the [underlying dataset(s)](service-get-data.md) and may even see complete questions listed if the dataset owner has created [featured questions](service-q-and-a-create-featured-questions.md),

   ![](media/power-bi-tutorial-q-and-a/powerbi-qna-cursor.png)

   You can always choose one of these questions as a starting point and continue to refine the question to find the specific answer you are looking for. Or, use a table name to help you word a new question.

2. Select from the dataset options or begin typing your own question and select from the dropdown suggestions.

3. As you type a question, Q&A picks the best [visualization ](visuals/power-bi-visualization-types-for-reports-and-q-and-a.md)to display your answer; and the visualization changes dynamically as you modify the question.

   ![](media/power-bi-tutorial-q-and-a/powerbi-qna-viz.png)

4. When you type a question, Power BI looks for the best answer using any dataset that has a tile on that dashboard.  If all the tiles are from *datasetA*, then your answer will come from *datasetA*.  If there are tiles from *datasetA* and *datasetB*, then Q&A will search for the best answer from those 2 datasets.

   > [!TIP]
   > So be careful, if you only have one tile from *datasetA* and you remove it from your dashboard, Q&A will no longer have access to *datasetA*.

5. When you're happy with the result, [pin the visualization to a dashboard](service-dashboard-pin-tile-from-q-and-a.md) by selecting the pin icon in the top right corner. If the dashboard has been shared with you, or is part of an app, you won't be able to pin.

##    Part 2: Use Q&A in a report in Power BI service or Power BI Desktop

Use Q&A to explore your dataset and to add visualizations to the report and to dashboards. A report is based on a single dataset and may be completely blank or contain pages full of visualizations. But just because a report is blank, doesn't mean there isn't any data for you to explore -- the dataset is linked to the report and is waiting for you to explore and create visualizations.  To see which dataset is being used to create a report, open the report in Power BI service Reading view and select **View related** from the menubar.

![](media/power-bi-tutorial-q-and-a/power-bi-view-related.png)

In order to use Q&A in reports, you must have edit permissions for the report and underlying dataset. In the [Q&A Overview topic](consumer/end-user-q-and-a.md) we referred to this as a *creator* scenario. So if you are, instead, *consuming* a report that has been shared with you, Q&A will not be available.

1. Open a report in Editing view (Power BI service) or Report view (Power BI Desktop) and select **Ask a question** from the menubar.

    **Desktop**

    **Service**

2. A Q&A question box displays on your report canvas. In the example below, the question box displays on top of another visualization. This is fine, but it might be better to [add a blank page to the report](power-bi-report-add-page.md) before asking a question.

    ![](media/power-bi-tutorial-q-and-a/power-bi-ask-question.png)

3. Place your cursor in the question box. As you type, Q&A displays suggestions to help you form your question.

   ![](media/power-bi-tutorial-q-and-a/power-bi-q-and-a-suggestions.png)

4. As you type a question, Q&A picks the best [visualization ](visuals/power-bi-visualization-types-for-reports-and-q-and-a.md)to display your answer; and the visualization changes dynamically as you modify the question.

   ![](media/power-bi-tutorial-q-and-a/power-bi-q-and-a-visual.png)

5. When you have the visualization you like, select ENTER. To save the visualization with the report, select **File > Save**.

6. Interact with the new visualization. It doesn't matter how you created the visualization -- all the same interactivity, formatting, and features are available.

   ![](media/power-bi-tutorial-q-and-a/power-bi-q-and-a-ellipses.png)

   If you've created the visualization in Power BI service, you can even [pin it to a dashboard](service-dashboard-pin-tile-from-q-and-a.md).

## Tell Q&A which visualization to use.
With Q&A, not only can you ask your data to speak for itself, you can tell Power BI how to display the answer. Just add "as a <visualization type>" to the end of your question.  For example, "show inventory volume by plant as a map" and "show total inventory as a card".  Try it for yourself.

##  Considerations and troubleshooting
- If you've connected to a dataset using a live connection or gateway, Q&A needs to be [enabled for that dataset](consumer/end-user-q-and-a-direct-query.md).

- You've opened a report and don't see the Q&A option. If you're using Power BI service, make sure the report is open in Editing view. If you can't open Editing view it means you don't have edit permissions for that report and won't be able to use Q&A with that specific report.
