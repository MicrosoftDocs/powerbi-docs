# Extended Pro Trial activation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Extended Pro Trial is no longer available. To sign up for a free trial (if eligible), see [Signing up for Power BI as an individual](service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi.md). To purchase Power BI Pro, see [Purchase and assign Power BI Pro licenses](service-admin-purchasing-power-bi-pro.md).

As part of the [May 3, 2017 Power BI Premium announcement](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-accelerates-modern-bi-adoption-with-power-bi-premium/), Microsoft communicated changes to the free Power BI service effective June 1,2017. These changes included extending access to all data sources, higher workspace storage limits, and higher refresh and streaming rates, making those features equivalent to Power BI Pro.

Also announced was that sharing and collaboration features would be exclusive to Power BI Pro users, including peer-to-peer dashboard sharing, group workspaces (now called app workspaces), export to PowerPoint, and analyze in Excel with Power BI apps. Export to CSV/Excel and PowerPoint were identified in the May 3 communication as a capability limited to Power BI Pro. However, after receiving feedback from the broad user community, the strategy evolved, and we made the capability available to users of the free service as well.

Beginning June 1, 2017 existing users of the Free service who were active users on or before May 2, 2017 were eligible for a free, 12-month extended trial of Power BI Pro. The offer enabled users to take advantage of the full capabilities of Power BI Pro for a year as a sign of appreciation to the community and to provide users with time to adjust to the changes.

On June 1, 2017 eligible users received a notification when they signed into the service letting them know the changes had gone into effect with a prompt to register for the Extended Power BI Pro trial offer. A userâ€™s IT admin dis not control the related in-product notifications, nor did the IT admin have the ability to register for the extended Power BI Pro trial on behalf of a user. Each eligible user must have individually taken action to complete this process.

Users could opt to register for the offer at any time during the 12-month period, but the Extended Pro trial concluded on May 31, 2018 regardless of when users accepted the offer. At that time users had the option to purchase Power BI Pro or be converted to the free version of Power BI, without the sharing and collaboration capabilities, if they elected not to take action and purchase Power BI Pro.

No changes were made to Power BI Pro at the time. Power BI Pro users were not impacted and did not receive notifications when they signed into the service on June 1, 2017 or after. Users who declined the extended Power BI Pro trial offer or were ineligible for the offer could continue using the free version of Power BI without the sharing and collaboration capabilities. They could register at any time for a standard 60-day Power BI Pro trial by visiting the Power BI [website](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/get-started/).

## Eligibility for Extended Pro Trial

Your account must have met the following requirements in order to be eligible for the Extended Pro Trial offer.

* Power BI Free users active between May 3, 2016 and May 2, 2017 were eligible for an Extended Pro Trial.

* Users that had previously used or were currently on the *60-day in-product Pro trial* were still eligible for the Extended Pro Trial.

> [!NOTE]
> Users that had licenses assigned from the Power BI Pro or Power BI Pro Trial subscriptions, within Office 365, were excluded from this offer.

## Frequently asked questions

**What happens to new users who signed up after May 3, 2017?**

Users who signed up to Power BI Free on or after May 3, 2017 are not eligible for the Extended Pro Trial. However, they are eligible for the standard 60-day Pro Trial.

**How do I find out who in my organization is eligible for the Extended Pro Trial?**

While there is not a direct way to discover this, you can view the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Integrated Applications report for Power BI to see who are active users within your organization within the last 30 days. This may give you an idea of who may be eligible. For more information, see [Find Power BI users that have signed in](service-admin-access-usage.md).

Those active users in the eligibility period, and who are on free licenses, receive the pop-up notification.

> [!NOTE]
> The Azure AD report does not indicate if a user has a free or Pro license within Power BI. It only reports which users have signed in to Power BI and when they signed in. If a user is listed in this report, it does not necessarily mean that they are eligible for the Extended Pro Trial.

**Can admins restrict a user from activating the Extended Pro Trial?**

No. Admins do not have a way to restrict users from activating the Extended Pro Trial or the in-service 60-day trial of Power BI Pro.
