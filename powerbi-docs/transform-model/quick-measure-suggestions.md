# Quick measure suggestions with Copilot

Quick measure suggestions to assist creation of DAX formulas for [model measures](/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-tutorial-create-measures) using natural language is available in [DAX query view](/power-bi/transform-model/dax-query-view) using [Microsoft Fabric Copilot to write and explain DAX queries](/dax/dax-copilot). You can create measures in a DAX query that can be added to your model when you're ready. 

In addition, there are other features available to aggregate data in a visual. [Quick measures](/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-quick-measures) can help you create DAX measures using a template approach for commonly used measures, such as month-over-month change. [Visual calculations](/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-visual-calculations-overview) can create a DAX calculation such as running totals directly in a visual. 

The **Suggestions with Copilot** shows as disabled in Power BI Desktop versions before October 2024.
