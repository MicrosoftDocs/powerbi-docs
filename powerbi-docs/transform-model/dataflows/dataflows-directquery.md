# Use DirectQuery with dataflows

Using DirectQuery with Power BI dataflows lets you connect directly to a dataflow without the need to import the data into a semantic model. There are many reasons why using DirectQuery with dataflows, rather than importing data, is useful and helpful. The following are a few examples:

* Working with large dataflows
* Decreasing orchestration needs for dataflows
* Serving data to customers in a managed and performance-minded way
* Preventing the need to duplicate data in a dataflow and an imported semantic model

## Configurations

To use DirectQuery with dataflows, you must explicitly toggle the **enhanced compute engine** to **On** in dataflow settings. You must then refresh the dataflow before it can be consumed in DirectQuery mode.

1. Navigate to the Premium dataflow, and set **enhanced compute engine** to **On**.
2. Refresh the dataflow.

After you complete the steps, the dataflow is accessible in Power BI Desktop with DirectQuery mode.

## Consumption

When DirectQuery is available for a dataflow, connecting to a dataflow by using the **Dataflows** connector prompts you to choose whether to connect to tables through DirectQuery or Import.

Dataflow entities that support DirectQuery display the **View** icon in Power BI Desktop, rather than the **Table** icon. The View icon appears as two boxes overlaid on each other, the Table icon is a single table with a grid.

The following image shows the **View** icon, indicating that the *Orders* table supports DirectQuery:

This image shows the **Table** icon, indicating that the *Query* table only supports import:

In DirectQuery mode, you can quickly interrogate large-scale semantic models locally. However, you can't currently perform any other transformations.
