# Configuring Azure Log Analytics for Power BI (Preview)

Power BI is integrating with Azure Log Analytics (LA) to enable administrators and Premium workspace owners to configure a Log Analytics connection to their Power BI subscription. This article describes how the integration between Log Analytics and Power BI works, and how to configure it for your environment. 

There are two elements to getting Azure Log Analytics working for Power BI: configuring your Azure subscription in the Azure portal, and enabling Log analytics for Power BI in the Power BI Admin portal. The following sections take you through the steps in each, in turn.

## Pre-requisites

Before you can configure Log Analytics integration from Power BI, you need to [create a Log Analytics Workspace](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/quick-create-workspace) in the Azure portal. You must also give permission in Azure for the Power BI service to write logs. The exact requirements are:

* Register the 'microsoft.insights' resource provider in the Azure subscription where you will collect Power BI log data
* The user who will set up Log Analytics integration in Power BI must be in the Owner role for the Log Analytics Workspace. See FAQ for workarounds if Owner cannot be given.
* The service principal 'Power BI Service' must be in the Owner role for the Log Analytics Workspace.

The following section shows you how to meet these three requirements.

### Enable the 'microsoft.insights' Resource Provider

Log Analytics requires the 'microsoft.insights' resource provider enabled at the Azure subscription level. The following steps take you through the process.

1. Log into the Azure portal, select the subscription you want to use with Log Analytics and that contains your Log Analytics workspaces. In the **Settings** section, select **Resource providers** as shown in the following image.

    :::image type="content" source="media/desktop-log-analytics-overview/log-analytics-08.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting Resource providers in the Azure portal.":::

2. Search for **microsoft.insights** under **Resource providers** and then select **Register**. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/desktop-log-analytics-overview/log-analytics-09.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting registering microsoft.insights in the Azure portal.":::

### Set Permissions

1. Make sure the user configuring Log Analytics integration and the Power BI Service principal are in the **Owner** role of the Log Analytics workspace. When you select **Access control (IAM)** for the subscription in the Azure portal, and then select **Role assignments** from the top selections in the panel, the current user must see at least two entries: **Owner** for the user who will configure Log Analytics (1, in the following image), and **Owner** for the Power BI service (2, in the following image).

Once you've completed those steps, the Azure Log Analytics configuration portion is complete. The next section shows you how to continue and complete the configuration in the Power BI Admin portal.


## Allow Workspace-level Logging from the Admin Portal

A Power BI administrator must complete the following step to enable Azure Log Analytics for Power BI Premium workspaces. This will allow Power BI Premium workspace administrators to send their workspace logs to Azure Log Analytics when the pre-requisites have been met. 

1. In the **Power BI Admin portal** navigate to **Tenant Settings > Audit and usage settings** and expand **Azure Log Analytics connections for workspace administrators**. To allow workspace admins to enable Log Analytics, switch the slider to **Enabled** and specify the needed security groups under **Apply to**, as shown in the following image.

## Configure Logging in a Premium Workspace

1. In the **Premium** workspace, workspace admins can enable Log Analytics. To do so, navigate to **Settings** as shown in the following image.

    :::image type="content" source="media/desktop-log-analytics-overview/log-analytics-15.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting Settings for a Premium workspace.":::

2. In the **Settings** pane, select **Azure connections (preview)**, then expand **Log Analytics** as shown in the following image.

    :::image type="content" source="media/desktop-log-analytics-overview/log-analytics-16.png" alt-text="Screenshot of expanding Azure connections (preview).":::

3. Select the Azure subscription, Resource group, and then the Log Analytics workspace configured in the previous section, then select **Save**. When successfully completed, the expanded **Tenant-level Log Analytics (Preview)** section will look similar to the following image.

## Disconnect Azure Log Analytics

You can disconnect from Azure Log Analytics to stop sending logs to Azure. To disconnect, in the **Power BI Workspace Settings**, navigate to the **Log Analytics** settings. The following image shows the warning displayed when the **Disconnect from Azure** button is selected.

 Select **Save** to disconnect. 
 
> [!NOTE]
> When you disconnect a Power BI workspace from Azure Log Analytics, logs are not deleted. Your data remains in the Azure and follows the storage and retention policies you set there. 


## Usage scenarios

There are many ways that Azure Log Analytics and Power BI can help solve real-world challenges for your organization. Here are a few to consider:

* Identifying periods of high or unusual Analysis Services engine activity by capacity, workspace, report or user
* Analyzing query performance and trends, including external DirectQuery operations
* Analyzing dataset refresh duration, overlaps and processing steps
* Analyzing custom operations sent using the Premium XMLA endpoint

## Error conditions and resolutions
The following table provides a collection of common errors, the events or configurations that triggered them, and suggested resolutions. 

| **Trigger Condition** | **Type** | **Message** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User doesn't have permission to write to the Log Analytics Workspace | Error - cannot proceed | You need write permissions on this Log Analytics workspace to connect it to Power BI. Contact the person in your organization who manages Azure subscriptions to fix this. |
| User doesn't have permission to write to the Log Analytics workspace account | Error - cannot proceed | You need write permissions on this Log Analytics workspace to connect it to Power BI. |

## Sample Log Analytics KQL queries
The following collection of sample queries may be helpful when using Azure Log Analytics with Power BI. They can be executed directly in the Azure portal or through APIs to query the latest data, typically about 5-10 minutes old.


```sql
// log count per day for last 30d
PowerBIDatasetsWorkspace
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| summarize count() by format_datetime(TimeGenerated, 'yyyy-MM-dd')


// average query duration by day for last 30d
PowerBIDatasetsWorkspace
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where OperationName == 'QueryEnd'
| summarize avg(DurationMs) by format_datetime(TimeGenerated, 'yyyy-MM-dd')


//query duration percentiles for a single day in 1 hour bins
PowerBIDatasetsWorkspace
| where TimeGenerated >= todatetime('2021-04-28') and TimeGenerated <= todatetime('2021-04-29')
| where OperationName == 'QueryEnd'
| summarize percentiles(DurationMs, 0.5, 0.9) by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)


// refresh durations by workspace and dataset for last 7d
PowerBIDatasetsWorkspace
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where OperationName == 'CommandEnd'
| where ExecutingUser contains 'system'
| where EventText contains 'refresh'
| project WorkspaceName, DatasetName = ArtifactName, DurationMs

```
