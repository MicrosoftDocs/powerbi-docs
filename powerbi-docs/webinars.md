**[Simply Compelling — Tips for Better Visualization Design]**
<br>by Miranda Li
<br>*April 18th 2018 10:00AM PST, 1:00PM EST*

The human visual system has its own rules—we can easily see patterns presented to us in certain ways, but in other ways they're invisible. Therefore, we can apply rules for displaying information so that the important and informative patterns stand out. This session will walk you through a series of before-and-after case studies and teach you how to use visual perception to influence audience attention in data visualization design.
