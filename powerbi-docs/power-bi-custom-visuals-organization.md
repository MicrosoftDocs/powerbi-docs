# Organizational visuals in Power BI

You can use Power BI visuals in Power BI to create a unique type of visual that’s tailored to you. Power BI visuals are created by developers, and they're often created when the multitude of visuals that are included in Power BI don’t quite meet their need.

In some organizations, Power BI visuals are even more important – they might be necessary to convey specific data or insights unique to the organization, they may have special data requirements, or they may highlight private business methods. Such organizations need to develop Power BI visuals, share them throughout their organization, and make sure they’re properly maintained. Power BI Power BI visuals  lets organizations do just that.

Organizational visuals are deployed and managed by the Power BI administrator from the Admin portal. Once deployed into the organizational repository, users in the organization can easily discover them, and import the organizational Power BI visuals into their reports directly from Power BI Desktop.

## Considerations and limitations

* Visio visual, PowerApps visual, the Map box visual, and the GlobeMap visual from AppSource marketplace don't render if deployed through the organization repository.
