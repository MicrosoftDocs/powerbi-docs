# Take Power BI anywhere in mobile apps for your mobile device
You view your Power BI dashboards and reports in the Power BI service ([https://powerbi.com](https://powerbi.com)), and your on-premises Power BI reports on [Power BI Report Server](report-server/get-started.md). Now you can connect to your on-premises and cloud data from the Power BI mobile apps. Try viewing and interacting with your Power BI dashboards and reports on your mobile device &#151; be it iOS (iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, or Apple Watch), Android phone or tablet, or Windows 10 device.
