# Create featured questions for Power BI Q&A
If you own a dataset, you can add your own featured questions to that dataset. Power BI Q&A will show those questions to colleagues who consume reports based on that dataset.  Featured questions give your colleagues ideas about the types of questions they can ask about the dataset. The featured questions you add are up to you -- add popular questions, questions that display interesting results, or questions that may be hard to phrase.


> [!NOTE]
> Q&A featured questions are available for use in the [Microsoft Power BI app for iOS on iPads, iPhones, and iPod Touch devices](consumer/mobile/mobile-apps-ios-qna.md) and Power BI Desktop Q&A. Creating the questions is only available in the Power BI service (app.powerbi.com).

## Create a featured question

This article uses the [Retail Analysis Sales sample](sample-datasets.md). Follow these step-by-step instructions to try exploring a dataset yourself.

1. On the dashboard, select the Q&A question box.   Notice that Q&A is already being helpful by displaying a list of terms that appear in the dataset.
2. To add to this list, select the gear icon in the top-right corner of Power BI.

3. Select **Settings** &gt; **Datasets** &gt; **Retail Analysis sample** &gt; **Featured Q&A Questions**.  
4. Select **Add a question**.
