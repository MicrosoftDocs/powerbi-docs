# Create featured questions for Power BI Q&A
If you own a dataset, you can add your own featured questions to that dataset.  And Power BI Q&A will show those questions to colleagues who use (*consume*) your dataset.  Featured questions give your colleagues ideas about the types of questions they can ask about the dataset. The featured questions you add are up to you -- add popular questions, questions that display interesting results, or questions that may be hard to phrase.

Watch Will add some featured questions to Power BI Q&A and then use those featured questions to explore his dataset. Then follow the step-by-step instructions below the video to try it out yourself.

> [!NOTE]
> Q&A featured questions are available for use in the [Microsoft Power BI app for iOS on iPads, iPhones, and iPod Touch devices](consumer/mobile/mobile-apps-ios-qna.md) and Power BI Desktop Q&A Preview. But creating the questions is only available in Power BI service (app.powerbi.com).
