# Track Power BI service health in Microsoft 365

The Microsoft 365 admin center provides important tools for Power BI admins. The tools include current and historical information about service health. To access service health information, you must have the Fabric administrator role.

1. From the nav pane, select **Show all** > **Health** > **Service health**. The Service health page appears. Active issues are listed on this overview page:
