# Track Power BI service health in Microsoft 365

Track Power BI service health using the Microsoft 365 admin center to monitor current issues and view historical service data. Power BI admins can access these health monitoring tools to quickly identify and troubleshoot service problems. To access service health information, you must have the Fabric administrator role.

For more information about roles, see [Administrator roles related to Power BI](../admin/service-admin-administering-power-bi-in-your-organization.md#administrator-roles-related-to-power-bi).

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://portal.office.com/adminportal).
1. From the nav pane, select **Show all** > **Health** > **Service health**. The Service health page appears. Active issues are listed on this overview page:
