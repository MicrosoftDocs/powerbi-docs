# Resolve sign-in issues for Power BI and Fabric

This article describes how to resolve sign-in issues for Power BI and Fabric. If you're a Power BI or Fabric user having sign-in issues, first work with your organization's internal support team for assistance. If your organization enabled Self-Service Password Reset, you can reset your own password with the [Self-Service Password Reset wizard](https://passwordreset.microsoftonline.com/). If this process fails, a link to contact Support displays.

If you're an **admin** for your organization, we recommend that you [Enable users to unlock their account or reset passwords using Microsoft Entra self-service password reset](/azure/active-directory/authentication/tutorial-enable-sspr). If you forgot your own password, follow the steps in [Forgot sign-in password to Microsoft 365, Azure, or Intune](/microsoft-365/troubleshoot/sign-in/forgot-sign-in-password) to recover your password. To troubleshoot other sign-in issues, review the solutions listed in [You can't sign in to Microsoft 365, Azure, or Intune](/microsoft-365/troubleshoot/sign-in/sign-in-to-office-365-azure-intune).
