# Capture diagnostic information from the Power BI service

Before you contact Microsoft Support for help with a problem you're having with the Power BI service, you can collect files that will help us solve your problem. We recommend you get a browser trace from your browser session. A browser trace is a diagnostic file that can provide important details about what is happening in the Power BI service when the problem occurs.

Power BI admins can use the **Help + support** experience in the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/) to get self-help solutions and to contact Support. The diagnostic files that you collect by using the following steps can be attached to your support request to help with troubleshooting. For more support options, see [Power BI support options](service-support-options.md).

To collect a browser trace and other session information, use the proceeding steps for the browser you use. If you need to collect diagnostic information from Power BI Desktop, follow the instructions in [Power BI Desktop diagnostics collection](../fundamentals/desktop-diagnostics.md).

## Collect a browser trace

> [!IMPORTANT]
>Sign in to the [Power BI service](https://app.powerbi.com) *before* you start to collect browser trace information, no matter which browser you use. This step is important to make sure that the trace information doesn't include sensitive information related to your sign-in.

#### [Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge](#tab/google-chrome-or-microsoft-edge)

Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge (Chromium) are both based on the [Chromium open source project](https://www.chromium.org/Home). The following steps show how to use the developer tools, which are similar in the two browsers. For more information, see [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) and [Microsoft Edge (Chromium) Developer Tools](/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium). The following reference images are taken from Google Chrome.

1. After signing in, press F12 on your keyboard. Or, in Microsoft Edge select **Settings and more (...)** > **More tools** > **Developer tools**. In Google Chrome, select **Customize and control Google Chrome** :::image type="content" source="media/service-admin-capturing-additional-diagnostic-information-for-power-bi/chromium-icon-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Google Chrome settings menu icon." border="false"::: > **More tools** > **Developer tools**.
1. Prepare to collect the browser trace by setting trace options. You'll also stop and clear any information that was collected before you start to reproduce the problem. By default, the browser keeps trace information only for the page that's currently loaded. Follow these steps to set up the browser to keep all trace information, even if your repro goes to more than one page:
    1. In the **Developer tools** window, select the **Network** tab. Then, select **Preserve log**.

       :::image type="content" source="media/service-admin-capturing-additional-diagnostic-information-for-power-bi/browser-trace-preserve-log.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Google Chrome developer tools with network tab and preserve log selected." :::

    2. Select the **Console** tab, then select **Settings** > **Preserve log**.

       :::image type="content" source="media/service-admin-capturing-additional-diagnostic-information-for-power-bi/browser-trace-console-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Google Chrome developer tools with console tab and preserve log selected." :::

        Select **Settings** again to close the **Console settings**.

3. Next, stop and clear any recording in progress. Select the **Network** tab, select **Stop recording network log**, then **Clear**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/service-admin-capturing-additional-diagnostic-information-for-power-bi/browser-trace-stop-recording.png" alt-text=" Screenshot of the Google Chrome developer tools with network tab and stop and clear recording options selected." :::

2. Now, you'll reproduce the problem that you were having in the Power BI service. To start, in **Developer tools** select the **Network** tab. Select **Record network log**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >Refresh the browser page in the Power BI service before you start to reproduce the problem so that traces are correctly captured.

   Reproduce the steps that resulted in the problem you need help with.
