# Service interruption notifications

It's important to have insight into the availability of your mission-critical business applications. Power BI provides incident notification so you can optionally receive emails if there's a service disruption or degradation. While the Power BI 99.9% service level agreement (SLA) makes these occurrences rare, it's still possible for disruptions to occur. The following screenshot shows the type of email you'll receive if you enable notifications:

At this time, emails are sent for the following _reliability scenarios_:

- Open report reliability
- Model refresh reliability
- Query refresh reliability

Notifications are sent when there's an _extended delay_ in operations like opening reports, semantic model refresh, or query executions. After an incident is resolved, you receive a follow-up email.

## Enable notifications for service outages or incidents

A Power BI admin can enable notifications for service outages or incidents in the admin portal:

1. Identify or create an email-enabled security group that should receive notifications.

1. In the admin portal, select **Tenant settings**. Under **Help and support settings**, expand **Receive email notifications for service outages or incidents**.

1. Enable notifications, enter a security group, and select **Apply**.

> [!NOTE]
> Power BI sends notifications from the account no-reply-powerbi@microsoft.com. Ensure that this account is added to your safe sender list so that notifications don't end up in a junk email folder.
