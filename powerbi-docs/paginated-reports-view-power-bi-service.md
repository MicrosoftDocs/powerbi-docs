# View a paginated report in the Power BI service

In this article, you learn about viewing a paginated report to the Power BI service. Paginated reports are reports created in Report Builder and uploaded to any  workspace in a Premium capacity. Look for the diamond icon ![Power BI Premium capacity diamond icon](media/paginated-reports-save-to-power-bi-service/premium-diamond.png) next to the workspace name. 

Paginated reports have a their own icon, ![Paginated report icon](media/paginated-reports-view-power-bi-service/power-bi-paginated-report-icon.png).
