In this lesson, we're going to edit the original app we created previously, and see how that updates the other people who've connected to it.

I'm back in My Workspace, editing my original dashboard.

Anytime I make any change to the dashboard, I get this reminder that I've changed something that I've shared with others in a app, and prompting me to update the shared version.

I go back to the settings icon and select **View app** to see the apps I've already published.

I see the app I made. This little icon tells me I've changed something in the app, and I need to edit the app so others can see my changes.

When I select **Edit**, I'm back at the screen where I can edit the title and description, but this time it has an **Update** button, so I select that.

Power BI takes those changes and publishes the updated app to the app gallery.

Anybody who has connected to my app gets a message that the app has changed, and asks if they want to accept the changes or keep the older version.

So as the app owner, you can manage the versions that your colleagues are using.
