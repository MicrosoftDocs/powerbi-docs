You may find that occasionally when you create your dashboards, you have more content than what can fit on your canvas. There are a few solutions that help you manage how your dashboard space is displayed, so you can get a full view of your dashboard content.

The easiest method to display your entire dashboard in one screen is selecting the **Full Screen Mode** button in the top right-hand corner of the dashboard.

Selecting the **Full Screen Mode** button puts your browser into full screen mode, removing all chrome elements from around the dashboard, and thereby increasing the amount of viewable space.

From within **Full-Screen Mode**, you can select the **Fit to Screen** option to shrink all of your tiles so they fit on a single screen, without the need for scrollbars. This is commonly called *TV mode*, and is useful for giving presentations with dashboards, or displaying a dashboard on hallway monitors.

Another way to manage dashboard space is collapsing the nav pane on the left-hand side of the page, by selecting the hamburger icon. To expand the nav pane, click the icon again.

You can ensure that a dashboard will always have a collapsed nav pane by appending the following to the end of the URL:

> ?collapseNavigation=true
> 
> 

Users who follow that link will open the dashboard with a collapsed nav pane.
