# Power BI Premium FAQ

This article addresses questions frequently asked about Power BI Premium. For an overview, see [What is Power BI Premium?](service-premium-what-is.md).

* If you have other questions, [try asking the Power BI Community](https://community.powerbi.com/).
* Still have an issue? Please visit the [Power BI support page](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/support/).

**What is Power BI Premium?**  
Power BI Premium is a capacity-based offering that includes:

* Flexibility to publish reports broadly across an enterprise, without requiring recipients to be licensed individually per user.
* Greater scale and performance than shared capacity in the Power BI service.
* The ability to maintain BI assets on-premises with Power BI Report Server.
* One API surface, a consistent set of capabilities, and access to the latest features for embedded analytics.

**What does Power BI Premium do? How does it work?**  
Power BI Premium consists of capacity in the Power BI service exclusively allocated to each organization. The capacity is supported by dedicated hardware fully managed by Microsoft. Organizations can choose to apply their dedicated capacity broadly, or allocate it to assigned workspaces based on the number of users, workload needs, or other factors—and scale up or down as requirements change.

**How is Power BI Pro different than Power BI Premium?**  
Power BI Premium is a capacity-based license, while Power BI Pro is a user-based license. Power BI Pro is for those users publishing reports, sharing dashboards, collaborating with colleagues in workspaces and engaging in other related activities – such as the ability to:

* Edit and save customized views
* Create personal dashboards (pin to new dashboard)
* Analyze data in Excel or Power BI Desktop
* Share with Excel Web App support
* Share dashboards and collaborate with Office 365 Groups
* Integrate content with Microsoft Teams

**Do I need Power BI Pro to use Power BI Premium?**  
Yes. Power BI Pro is required to publish reports, share dashboards, collaborate with colleagues in workspaces and engage in other related activities. Power BI Pro isn't required to consume content in Premium capacity.

**Can you outline a scenario of how Power BI Pro and Power BI Premium work to cover an organization for Modern BI?**  
The following examples outline how customers can meet their BI needs using a combination of Power BI Pro and Power BI Premium.

| Scenario 1 | Scenario 2 | Scenario 3 | Scenario 4 |

**How much does Power BI Premium cost? How many SKUs will you make available?**  
Power BI Premium is purchased based on the number of virtual cores. You can see prices at the [Power BI pricing page](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/pricing/). For more information on nodes and v-cores, see the [Microsoft Power BI Premium whitepaper](https://aka.ms/pbipremiumwhitepaper). Also use this [calculator](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/calculator/) to get an estimate of how much Premium capacity you may need.

**What do you mean by "capacity"?**  
A capacity is a grouping of one or more nodes that is provisioned by an admin through the Power BI Premium capacity admin portal. See the [Microsoft Power BI Premium whitepaper](https://aka.ms/pbipremiumwhitepaper) for more information.

**How is Power BI Premium billed?**  
Power BI Premium is billed monthly with an annual commitment.

Power BI Premium is available from the Microsoft 365 admin center. For more information, see [How to purchase Power BI Premium](service-admin-premium-purchase.md). You can also contact your Microsoft representative for more information.

**Is Power BI Premium available with Office 365 E5?**  
Power BI Premium is available as an add-on to Power BI Pro. Office 365 E5 includes Power BI Pro. E5 customers can purchase Premium as an add-on to their existing Pro licenses.

**What is Power BI Report Server? Does this mean you’re making Power BI available on-premises?**

Power BI Report Server is an on-premises server that allows the deployment and distribution of interactive Power BI reports, and paginated reports, completely within the boundaries of the organization’s firewall. Power BI Report Server is available through Power BI Premium or as a benefit for customers with SQL Server Enterprise Edition with Software Assurance. For information about licensing, see [Licensing Power BI Report Server](report-server/get-started.md#licensing-power-bi-report-server). Contact your Microsoft representative for details.

With Power BI Premium, the same number of virtual cores an organization provisions in the cloud can also be deployed on-premises through Power BI Report Server. There is no need to split the capacity. Organizations can choose Power BI in the cloud, or elect to keep reports on-premises with Power BI Report Server and move to the cloud at their pace.

For more information, see [Get started with Power BI Report Server](report-server/get-started.md).
