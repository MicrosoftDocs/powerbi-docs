# How to purchase Power BI Premium

> [!NOTE]
> This article is currently being updated to describe new features, provide more details, and improve readability. 

This article describes how to purchase Power BI Premium capacity (P1-P3) for your organization. You purchase Power BI Premium capacity in the Microsoft 365 admin center, and you manage your capacities in the Power BI admin portal. For current pricing and planning information, see the [Power BI pricing page](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/pricing/) and the [Power BI Premium calculator](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/calculator/).

Content creators still need a Power BI Pro license, even if your organization uses Power BI Premium. Ensure you purchase at least one Power BI Pro license for your organization.

If a Premium subscription expires, you have 30 days of full access to your capacity. After that, your content reverts to a shared capacity. Models that are greater than 1 GB will are not supported in shared capacity.

## Create a new tenant with Power BI Premium P1

If you don't have an existing tenant and want to create one, you can purchase Power BI Premium at the same time. The following link walks you through the process of creating a new tenant and enables you to purchase Power BI Premium: [Power BI Premium P1 offer](https://signup.microsoft.com/Signup?OfferId=b3ec5615-cc11-48de-967d-8d79f7cb0af1). When you create your tenant, you will automatically be assigned to the Office 365 Global Administrator role for that tenant.

## Purchase a Power BI Premium capacity for an existing organization

If you have an existing organization (tenant), you must be in the Office 365 Global Administrator role or Billing Administrator role to purchase subscriptions and licenses.
