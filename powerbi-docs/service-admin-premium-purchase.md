## Create a new tenant with Power BI Premium P1
If you don't have an existing tenant and want to create one, you can purchase Power BI Premium at the same time. The following link will walk you through the process of creating a new tenant for use with Office 365 and allow you to purchase Power BI Premium. You will need to purchase a Power BI Pro license for a user after the tenant is created. When you create your tenant, you will automatically be the Global Admin for that tenant.

To make this purchase, see [Power BI Premium P1 offer](https://signup.microsoft.com/Signup?OfferId=b3ec5615-cc11-48de-967d-8d79f7cb0af1).
