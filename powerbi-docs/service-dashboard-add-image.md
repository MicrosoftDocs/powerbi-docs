# Add an image to a Power BI dashboard
There are several ways to add a standalone image to a dashboard: one way is to pin an image from a report to a dashboard and another way is to add it directly onto the dashboard using **Add tile**.  For more information, visit these articles:

* [Add dashboard tiles directly from a Power BI dashboard](service-dashboard-add-widget.md).
* [Pin images from a Power BI report](service-dashboard-pin-tile-from-report.md).
