# Connect to the Regional Government Emergency Response Dashboard
The Regional Government Emergency Response Dashboard is the reporting component of the [Microsoft Power Platform Regional Government Emergency Response and Monitoring solution](/powerapps/sample-apps/regional-emergency-response/overview). Regional organization admins can view the dashboard in their Power BI tenant, enabling them to quickly view important data and metrics that will help them make efficient decisions.

This article tells you how to install the Regional Government Emergency Response app using the Regional Government Emergency Response Dashboard template app, and how to connect to the data sources.

For detailed information about what is presented in the dashboard, see [Get insights](/powerapps/sample-apps/regional-emergency-response/portals-admin-reporting#get-insights).

After you've installed the template app and connected to the data sources, you can customize the report as per your needs. You can then distribute it as an app to colleagues in your organization.

## Prerequisites

When installing the Regional Government Emergency Response and Monitoring solution, take note of the [URL of your Dataverse environment instance](/powerapps/sample-apps/regional-emergency-response/deploy#step-5-configure-and-publish-power-bi-dashboard). You'll need it to connect the template app to the data.
