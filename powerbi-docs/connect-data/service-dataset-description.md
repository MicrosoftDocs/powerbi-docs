# Semantic model description

Semantic model descriptions help users in your organization quickly identify and reuse relevant datasets in Power BI. Add a concise, informative description in your semantic model's settings to improve discovery. Users see this description in the tooltip next to the semantic model's name in the semantic models hub and on the semantic model's details page.

Providing a meaningful description helps foster semantic model reuse. For instance, based on a semantic model's description, users might decide to explore existing reports or create their own reports based on the semantic model.

## Provide a semantic model description

To provide a description for a semantic model, go to the semantic model's settings page, find the Semantic model description section, and enter your description in the text box.

On the settings page, find the **Semantic model description** section and enter your description in the text box. Select **Apply** to save your description.
