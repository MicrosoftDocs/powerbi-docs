# Semantic model description

To help members of your organization quickly identify semantic models that might be useful for them, provide a concise, informative description of your semantic model in the semantic model's settings. Users see this description in the tooltip next to the semantic model's name in the semantic models hub and on the semantic model's details page.

Providing a meaningful description helps foster semantic model reuse. For instance, based on a semantic model's description, users might decide to explore reports that are based on the semantic model, or to create their own reports based on the semantic model.

## Provide a semantic model description

To provide a description for a semantic model, go to the semantic model's settings page, find the Semantic model description section, and enter your description in the text box.

On the settings page, find the **Semantic model description** section and enter your description in the text box. Select **Apply** to save your description.
