# Connect to GitHub with Power BI

Connect your GitHub account to Power BI using the template app to explore repository insights and data. The template app generates a workspace with a dashboard, reports, and a semantic model for analyzing contributions, issues, pull requests, and active users in your GitHub repositories.

:::image type="content" source="media/service-connect-to-github/service-github-app-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot of GitHub template app report showing insights and data visualizations.":::

After you install the template app, you can change the dashboard and report. Then you can distribute it as an app to colleagues in your organization.

Connect to the [GitHub template app](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/getapps/services/pbi-contentpacks.pbiapps-github) or read more about the [GitHub integration](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/integrations/github) with Power BI.

You can also try the [GitHub tutorial](service-tutorial-connect-to-github.md). It installs real GitHub data about the public repo for the Power BI documentation.

> [!NOTE]
> This template app requires the GitHub account to have access to the repo.
>
> This template app does not support GitHub Enterprise.

## Install the app

1. Click the following link to get to the app: [GitHub template app](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/getapps/services/pbi-contentpacks.pbiapps-github)

1. On the AppSource page for the app, select [**GET IT NOW**](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/getapps/services/pbi-contentpacks.pbiapps-github).

    :::image type="content" source="media/service-connect-to-github/service-github-template-app-appsource-get-it-now.png" alt-text="Screenshot of GitHub template app in AppSource with GET IT NOW button.":::

1. Select **Install**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/service-connect-to-github/power-bi-github-install-dialog.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Install the GitHub template app dialog.":::

    Once the app has installed, you see it on your Apps page.

   :::image type="content" source="media/service-connect-to-github/service-github-app-apps-page-icon.png" alt-text="Screenshot of GitHub app icon on Apps page.":::

## Connect to data sources

1. Select the icon on your Apps page to open the app.

   The app opens, showing sample data.

1. Select the **Connect your data** link on the banner at the top of the page.

   :::image type="content" source="media/service-connect-to-github/service-github-app-connect-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot of GitHub app connect your data link.":::

1. This opens the parameters dialog, where you change the data source from the sample data to your own data source (see [known limitations](service-template-apps-overview.md#known-limitations)), followed by the authentication method dialog. You may have to redefine the values in these dialogs.

   :::image type="content" source="media/service-connect-to-github/power-bi-template-app-connect-to-data-dialogs.png" alt-text="Screenshot of connect to data dialogs.":::

1. Enter your GitHub credentials and follow the GitHub authentication process (this step might be skipped if you're already signed in with your browser).

   :::image type="content" source="media/service-connect-to-github/power-bi-github-authenticate-process.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Power BI GitHub authenticate process.":::

Once you finish filling out the connection dialogs and signed in to GitHub, the connection process starts. A banner informs you that the data is being refreshed, and that in the meantime you're viewing sample data.

:::image type="content" source="media/service-connect-to-github/service-github-app-refresh-monitor.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Power BI GitHub app refresh in progress.":::

Your report data will automatically refresh once a day, unless you disabled this during the sign-in process. You can also [set up your own refresh schedule](./refresh-scheduled-refresh.md) to keep the report data up to date if you so desire.

## Customize and share

To customize and share your app, select the pencil icon at the top right corner of the page.

:::image type="content" source="media/service-template-apps-install-distribute/power-bi-template-app-edit-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Edit app button.":::

For information about editing items in the workspace, see

* [Tour the report editor in Power BI](../create-reports/service-the-report-editor-take-a-tour.md)
* [Basic concepts for designers in the Power BI service](../fundamentals/service-basic-concepts.md)

Once you're done making any changes you wish to the items in the workspace, you're ready to publish and share the app. See [Create and publish your app](../collaborate-share/service-create-distribute-apps.md) to learn how to do this.

## What's included in the app

The following data is available from GitHub in Power BI:

| Table name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Contributions |The contributions table gives the total additions, deletions, and commits authored by the contributor aggregated per week. The top 100 contributors are included. |
| Issues |List all issues for the selected repo and it contains calculations like total and average time to close an issue, Total open issues,  Total closed issues. This table is empty when there are no issues in the repo. |
| Pull requests |This table contains all the Pull Requests for the repo and who pulled the request. It also contains calculations around how many open, closed, and total pull requests, how long it took to pull the requests and how long the average pull request took. This table is empty when there are no pull requests in the repo. |
| Users |This table provides a list of GitHub users or contributors who have made contributions, filed issues, or solved Pull requests for the repo selected. |
| Milestones |It has all the Milestones for the selected repo. |
| DateTable |This table contains dates from today and for years in the past that allow you to analyze your GitHub data by date. |
| ContributionPunchCard |This table can be used as a contribution punch card for the selected repo. It shows commits by day of week and hour of day. This table is not connected to other tables in the model. |
| RepoDetails |This table provides details for the repo selected. |

## System requirements

* The GitHub account that has access to the repo.  
* Permission granted to the Power BI for GitHub app during first login. See details on revoking access on this page.  
* Sufficient API calls available to pull and refresh the data.

> [!NOTE]
> This template app does not support GitHub Enterprise.

### Deauthorize Power BI

To deauthorize Power BI from being connected to your GitHub repo, you can Revoke access in GitHub. See this [GitHub help](https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-ssh-keys-and-application-access-tokens-safe/#reviewing-your-authorized-applications-oauth) topic for details.

## Finding parameters

You can determine the owner and repository by looking at the repository in GitHub itself:

:::image type="content" source="media/service-connect-to-github/github_ownerrepo.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Repo name and owner in GitHub.":::

The first part "Azure" is the owner and the second part "azure-sdk-for-php" is the repository itself.  You see these same two items in the URL of the repository:

```console
<https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-php> .
```

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub app not appearing in Apps list

If you cannot find the GitHub app in your Power BI Apps list, consider the following:

1. **The app must be installed first**: The GitHub app only appears in your Apps list after you have installed it. Use the installation link provided in the [Install the app](#install-the-app) section to access and install the app from AppSource.
1. **Check template app permissions**: Your organization's Power BI administrator may have restricted the ability to install template apps. Contact your administrator to verify that template app installation is enabled for your tenant. See [template app settings](../admin/service-admin-portal-template-app.md) for more information.
1. **AppSource availability**: If you cannot access the app through AppSource, try using the direct installation link: [GitHub template app](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/getapps/services/pbi-contentpacks.pbiapps-github)
1. **Look in the correct location**: In the Power BI service, select **Apps** from the navigation pane to view your installed apps. If you haven't installed the GitHub template app yet, it isn't in this list.

### Verifying GitHub credentials

If necessary, you can verify your GitHub credentials.  

1. In another browser window, go to the GitHub web site and sign in to GitHub. You can see you're logged in, in the upper-right corner of the GitHub site.
1. In GitHub, navigate to the URL of the repo you plan to access in Power BI. For example: <https://github.com/dotnet/corefx>.  
1. Back in Power BI, try connecting to GitHub. In the Configure GitHub dialog box, use the names of the repo and repo owner for that same repo.
