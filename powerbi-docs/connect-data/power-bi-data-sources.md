# Power BI data sources

This article provides general information on Power BI data sources including considerations, limitations, and links to additional resources.

Power BI uses Power Query to connect to data sources. **Power BI data sources** are documented in the following article: [Power Query (including Power BI) connectors](/power-query/connectors/).

Each data source article in the Power Query documentation describes the capabilities of the data connector, such as whether DirectQuery is supported. The following image shows the **Capabilities supported** section for [Azure Data Explorer (Kusto)](/power-query/connectors/azure-data-explorer#capabilities-supported), where it states that DirectQuery is supported for the connector in Power BI. If DirectQuery (or any other capability) isn't listed, the capability isn't supported.

For a list of the connectors available in Power Query, see [Connectors in Power Query](/power-query/connectors/).

For information about dataflows in Power BI, see [Configure and consume a dataflow](../transform-model/dataflows/dataflows-configure-consume.md).

## Considerations and limitations

- Many data connectors for Power BI Desktop require Internet Explorer 10 (or newer) for authentication. 
- Some data sources are available in Power BI Desktop optimized for Power BI Report Server, but aren't supported when published to Power BI Report Server. See [Power BI report data sources in Power BI Report Server](../report-server/data-sources.md) for the list of supported data sources.
- Power BI Desktop and the Power BI service might send multiple queries for any given query, to get schema information or the data itself, based in part on whether data is cached. This behavior is by design. For more information, see the Power Query article that describes [why a query might run multiple times](/power-query/multiple-queries).
