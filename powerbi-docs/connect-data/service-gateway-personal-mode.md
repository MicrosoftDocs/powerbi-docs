# Use a personal gateway in Power BI

[!INCLUDE [gateway-rewrite](../includes/gateway-rewrite.md)]

The on-premises data gateway (personal mode) is a version of the on-premises data gateway that works only with Power BI. You can use a personal gateway to install a gateway on your own computer and get access to on-premises data. This article provides information on how to use a personal gateway in Power BI to easily and securely connect to on-premises data.

> [!NOTE]
> Each Power BI user can have only one personal mode gateway running. If the same user installs another personal mode gateway, even on a different computer, the most recent installation replaces the existing previous installation.

## On-premises data gateway vs. on-premises data gateway (personal mode)

## Use Fast Combine with the personal gateway

Fast Combine on a personal gateway helps you ignore specified privacy levels when you run queries. To enable Fast Combine for the on-premises data gateway (personal mode):

1. Use Windows File Explorer to open the file *\<localappdata>\\Microsoft\\On-premises data gateway (personal mode)\\Microsoft.PowerBI.DataMovement.Pipeline.GatewayCore.dll.config*.

2. At the end of the file, before `</Microsoft.PowerBI.DataMovement.Pipeline.GatewayCore.GatewayCoreSettings>`, add the following code, and then save the file.

    ```xml
    <setting name="EnableFastCombine" serializeAs="String">
       <value>true</value>
    </setting>
    ```

3. The setting takes effect in approximately one minute. To confirm that Fast Combine is working properly, try an on-demand refresh in the Power BI service.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

- **Question:** Can you run the on-premises data gateway (personal mode) side by side with the on-premises data gateway that used to be called the Enterprise gateway?
  
  **Answer:** Yes, both gateways can run simultaneously.

- **Question:** Can you run the on-premises data gateway (personal mode) as a service?
  
  **Answer:** No. The on-premises data gateway (personal mode) can run only as an application. To run a gateway as a service or in admin mode, use the [on-premises data gateway](/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-onprem), which used to be called the Enterprise gateway.

- **Question:** How often does the on-premises data gateway (personal mode) update?
  
  **Answer:** The personal gateway updates monthly.

- **Question:** Why does the personal gateway ask you to update your credentials?
  
  **Answer:** Many situations can trigger a request for credentials. The most common scenario is that you reinstalled the on-premises data gateway (personal mode) on a different machine than your original Power BI personal gateway. There could also be an issue in the data source, or Power BI failed to make a test connection, or a timeout or system error occurred.
  
  To update your credentials in the Power BI service, open the semantic model settings and choose **Data source credentials**.

- **Question:** How long is a personal gateway offline during an upgrade?
  
  **Answer:** Upgrading the personal gateway to a new version takes only few minutes.

- **Question:** Does the personal gateway support R and Python scripts?
  
  **Answer:** Yes, personal mode supports R and Python scripts.â€‹
