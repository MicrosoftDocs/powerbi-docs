# Connect to the Hospital Emergency Response Decision Support Dashboard

The Hospital Emergency Response Decision Support Dashboard template app is the reporting component of the [Microsoft Power Platform solution for healthcare emergency response](/powerapps/sample-apps/emergency-response/deploy-configure). The dashboard shows emergency managers aggregate data across their health system to help them make timely, informed decisions.

This article explains how to install the app and how to connect to the data sources. To learn how to use the report that you see with this app, see the [Hospital Emergency Response Decision Support Dashboard documentation](/powerapps/sample-apps/emergency-response/deploy-configure).

After you've installed the template app and connected to the data sources, you can customize the report as per your needs. You can then distribute it as an app to colleagues in your organization.

## Prerequisites

Before installing this template app, you must first install and set up the [Hospital Emergency Response Power Platform solution](/powerapps/sample-apps/emergency-response/deploy-configure). Installing this solution creates the data source references necessary to populate the app with data.

When installing Hospital Emergency Response Power Platform solution, take note of the [URL of your Dataverse environment instance](/powerapps/sample-apps/emergency-response/deploy-configure#publish-the-power-bi-dashboard). You need it to connect the template app to the data.
