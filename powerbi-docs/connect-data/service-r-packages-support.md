# Create visuals by using R packages in the Power BI service

You can use the powerful [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) to create visuals in the Power BI service. The Power BI service supports almost thousand packages.  

The following sections provide an alphabetical table of which R packages are supported in Power BI, and which aren't. For more information about R in Power BI, see the [R visuals](../visuals/service-r-visuals.md) article.

## Requirements and limitations of R packages

* The Power BI service supports R packages with free and open-source software licenses such as GPL-2, GPL-3, MIT+, and so on.
* The Power BI service supports packages published in the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). The service doesn't support private or custom R packages. Users are encouraged to make their private packages available on CRAN prior to requesting the package be available in the Power BI service.
* The Power BI Desktop has two variations for R packages:
  * For R visuals, you can install any package, including custom R packages
  * For Custom R visuals, only public CRAN packages are supported for autoinstallation of the packages
* For security and privacy reasons, R packages that provide client-server queries over the web, such as *RgoogleMaps*, in the service, aren't supported. Networking is blocked for such attempts. See the following section for a list of supported and unsupported R packages.
* The approval process for including a new R package has a tree of dependencies. Some dependencies required to be installed in the service can't be supported.

### For reports in Premium/Fabric backed workspaces
* Current R runtime: R 4.3.3

## R packages that are supported in Power BI (Premium/Fabric backed workspaces and Pro/PPU)

## R scripts that aren't supported in Power BI

The following table shows which packages aren't supported in the Power BI service.

| Package | Request Date | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RgoogleMaps |10/05/2016 |Networking is blocked |
| mailR |10/03/2016 |Networking is blocked |
| RevoScaleR |8/30/2016 |Ships only with Microsoft R Server |


## Considerations and limitations

- R visuals are not supported in the service for non-Fabric regions and Sovereign clouds. Customers in these regions/clouds will continue to be able to use R visuals in Power BI desktop.

- R visuals aren't supported with Service Principal Profiles for App Owns Data.
- R visuals rendered from the Power BI service (for Premium/ F SKUs) are subject to a limit of 30Mb. This limit applies to the total payload of compressed input data and the R script itself. Always check R visuals after publishing the report to ensure the report will display as expected. 

- R visuals with HTML and XML packages with fail to render due to Out Of Memory (OOM) limits. Migrate the visual with the [PbiViz tool](../developer/visuals/develop-power-bi-visuals.md#power-bi-visual-packages). The visual must render to be considered successfully migrated. 

- [Publish to web](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-publish-to-web) isn't supported for R visuals. Reports with R visuals can still be published publicly, but any R visuals will not render (charts will appear empty).
