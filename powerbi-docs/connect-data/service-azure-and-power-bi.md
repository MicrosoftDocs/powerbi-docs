# Azure and Power BI

With **Azure** services and **Power BI**, you can turn your data processing efforts into analytics and reports that provide real-time insights into your business. Whether your data processing is cloud-based or on-premises, straightforward, or complex, single-sourced or massively scaled, warehoused, or real-time, Azure and Power BI have the built-in connectivity and integration to bring your business intelligence efforts to life.

Power BI has a multitude of Azure connections available, and the business intelligence solutions you can create with those services are as unique as your business. You can connect as few as one Azure data source, or a handful, then shape and refine your data to build customized reports.

## Azure SQL Database and Power BI

You can start with a straightforward connection to an Azure SQL Database, and create reports to monitor the progress of your business. Using the [Power BI Desktop](../fundamentals/desktop-getting-started.md), you can create reports that  identify trends and key performance indicators that move your business forward.

There's plenty more information for you to learn about [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/).

## Transform, shape, and merge your cloud data

Do you have more complex data, and all sorts of sources? No problem. With **Power BI Desktop** and Azure services, connections are just a tap of the **Get Data** dialog away. Within the same Query you can connect to your **Azure SQL Database**, your **Azure HDInsight** data source, and your **Azure Blob Storage** (or **Azure Table Storage**), then select only the subsets within each that you need, and refine it from there.

You can create different reports for different audiences too, using the same data connections and even the same Query. Just build a new report page, refine your visualizations for each audience, and watch it keep the business in the know.

* [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/) (Blob storage and Table storage)

## Get complex (and ahead) using Azure Services and Power BI

You can expand as much as you need with Azure and Power BI. Harness multi-source data processing, make use of massive real-time systems, use [Stream Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/stream-analytics/)and [Event Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-hubs/), and coalesce your varied SaaS services into business intelligence reports that give your business an edge.
