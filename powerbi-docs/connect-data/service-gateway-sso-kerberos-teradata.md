# Use Kerberos for SSO to Teradata

This article describes a specific added requirement to successfully enable single sign-on (SSO) to Teradata from the Power BI service.

- If Teradata identifies user accounts by using *sAMAccountNames*, you must set `FullDomainResolutionEnabled` on the gateway to `True`.

- If Teradata identifies user accounts by using *User Principal Names (UPNs)*, keep `FullDomainResolutionEnabled` on the gateway set to `False`.

## Enable SSO for Teradata

To change the `FullDomainResolutionEnabled` configuration on the gateway to enable SSO for Teradata:

1. In the on-premises gateway directory at *%ProgramFiles%\On-premises data gateway*, open the configuration file *Microsoft.PowerBI.DataMovement.Pipeline.GatewayCore.dll.config*.

1. In the file, find the `FullDomainResolutionEnabled` property and change its value to `True`.

   ```xml
   <setting name=" FullDomainResolutionEnabled " serializeAs="String">
         <value>True</value>
   </setting>
   ```
