#customer intent: As a Power BI user, I want to learn how to configure scheduled refresh for a semantic model in the Power BI service so that I can keep my data up to date and ensure accurate insights in my reports and dashboards.

# Configure scheduled refresh

>[!NOTE]
>After two months of inactivity, scheduled refresh on your semantic model is paused. For more information, see [*Scheduled refresh*](#scheduled-refresh) later in this article.

This article describes the options available for scheduled refresh for the [On-premises data gateway (personal mode)](service-gateway-personal-mode.md) and the [On-premises data gateway](service-gateway-onprem.md). You specify refresh options in the following areas of the Power BI service: **Gateway connection**, **Data source credentials**, and **Schedule refresh**. We'll look at each in turn. For more information about data refresh, including limitations on refresh schedules, see [Data refresh](refresh-data.md#data-refresh).

To get to the **Schedule refresh** screen:

1. Go to the workspace and select a semantic model from the workspace content list.

1. On the semantic model details page, select **Refresh** > **Schedule refresh**.

## Gateway and cloud connections

You'll see different options here depending on whether you have a personal gateway or enterprise gateway online and available.

If no gateway is available, you'll see **Gateway connection** disabled. You'll also see a message indicating how to install the personal gateway.

If you have a personal gateway configured and it's online, it's available to select. It shows offline if it's not available.

You can also select the enterprise gateway if one is available for you. You only see an enterprise gateway available if your account is listed in the **Users** tab of the data source configured for a given gateway.

## Data source credentials

### Power BI Gateway - Personal

If you're using the personal gateway to refresh data, you must supply the credentials to connect to the back-end data source. If you connected to an app from an online service, the credentials you entered to connect are carried over for scheduled refresh.

:::image type="content" source="media/refresh-scheduled-refresh/data-source-credentials-pgw.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Power BI service's Data source credentials dialog.":::

You're only required to sign in to a data source the first time you use refresh on that semantic model. Once entered, those credentials are retained with the semantic model.

> [!NOTE]
> For some authentication methods, if the password you use to sign in to a data source expires or is changed, you need to change it for the data source in **Data source credentials** too.

If there's a problem, typically it's either the gateway is offline because it couldn't sign in to Windows and start the service, or Power BI couldn't sign in to the data sources to query for updated data. If refresh fails, check the semantic model settings. If the gateway service is offline, **Status** is where you see the error. If Power BI can't sign in to the data sources, you see an error in Data source credentials.

### On-premises data gateway

If you're using the on-premises data gateway to refresh data, you don't need to supply credentials, as they're defined for the data source by the gateway administrator.

:::image type="content" source="media/refresh-scheduled-refresh/data-source-credentials-egw.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Power BI service's on-premises data gateway tab showing Data source credentials grayed out.":::

> [!NOTE]
> When connecting to on-premises SharePoint for data refresh, Power BI supports only *Anonymous*, *Basic*, and *Windows (NTLM/Kerberos)* authentication mechanisms. Power BI does not support *ADFS* or any *Forms-Based Authentication* mechanisms for data refresh of on-premises SharePoint data sources.

## Scheduled refresh

The **Refresh** section is where you define the frequency and time slots to refresh the semantic model. Some data sources don't require a gateway to be configurable for refresh, while other data sources require a gateway.

In a DirectQuery scenario, when a semantic model qualifies for performance optimization, **Refresh** will be moved to the **Optimize performance** section.

Set the **Configure a refresh schedule** slider to **On** to configure the settings.

> [!NOTE]
> The target is to initiate the refresh within 15 minutes of the scheduled time slot, but a delay of up to one hour can occur if the service can't allocate the required resources sooner. Refresh can begin as early as five minutes before the scheduled refresh time. 

:::image type="content" source="media/refresh-scheduled-refresh/scheduled-refresh.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Power BI service's Scheduled refresh dialog.":::

> [!NOTE]
> After two months of inactivity, scheduled refresh on your semantic model is paused. A semantic model is considered inactive when no user has visited any dashboard or report built on the semantic model. When scheduled refresh is paused, the semantic model owner is sent an email. The refresh schedule for the semantic model is then displayed as **disabled**. To resume scheduled refresh, revisit any dashboard or report built on the semantic model.

## What's supported?

> [!NOTE]
> Power BI deactivates your refresh schedule after four consecutive failures or when the service detects an unrecoverable error that requires a configuration update, such as invalid or expired credentials. It is not possible to change the consecutive failures threshold.

> [!TIP]
> Power BI does not have a monthly refresh interval option. However, you can use Power Automate to create a custom refresh interval that occurs monthly, as described in the following [Power BI blog post](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/refresh-your-power-bi-dataset-using-microsoft-flow/). 

Certain semantic models are supported against different gateways for scheduled refresh.

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes refreshing data might not go as expected, typically due to an issue connected with a gateway. See these gateway troubleshooting articles for tools and known issues.
