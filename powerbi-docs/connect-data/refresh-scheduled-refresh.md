#customer intent: As a Power BI user, I want to learn how to configure scheduled refresh for a semantic model in the Power BI service so that I can keep my data up to date and ensure accurate insights in my reports and dashboards.

# Configure scheduled refresh

> [!NOTE]
> Scheduled refresh is automatically paused after a period of inactivity. For details (including what counts as activity and how to resume), see the inactivity note in the [Scheduled refresh](#scheduled-refresh) section.

This article describes the options available for scheduled refresh for the [On-premises data gateway (personal mode)](service-gateway-personal-mode.md) and the [On-premises data gateway](service-gateway-onprem.md). You specify refresh options in the following areas of the Power BI service: **Gateway connection**, **Data source credentials**, and **Schedule refresh**. We'll look at each in turn. For more information about data refresh, including limitations on refresh schedules, see [Data refresh](refresh-data.md#data-refresh).

To get to the **Schedule refresh** screen:

1. Go to the workspace and select a semantic model from the workspace content list.

1. On the semantic model details page, select **Refresh** > **Schedule refresh**.

## Gateway and cloud connections

You'll see different options here depending on whether you have a personal gateway or enterprise gateway online and available.

If no gateway is available, you'll see **Gateway connection** disabled. You'll also see a message indicating how to install the personal gateway.

If you have a personal gateway configured and it's online, it's available to select. It shows offline if it's not available.

You can also select the enterprise gateway if one is available for you. You only see an enterprise gateway available if your account is listed in the **Users** tab of the data source configured for a given gateway.

## Data source credentials

### On-premises data gateway (personal mode)

If you're using the personal gateway to refresh data, you must supply the credentials to connect to the back-end data source. If you connected to an app from an online service, the credentials you entered to connect are carried over for scheduled refresh.

:::image type="content" source="media/refresh-scheduled-refresh/data-source-credentials-pgw.png" alt-text="Screenshot of data source credentials dialog for a semantic model using a personal gateway.":::

You're only required to sign in to a data source the first time you use refresh on that semantic model. Once entered, those credentials are retained with the semantic model.

> [!NOTE]
> For some authentication methods, if the password you use to sign in to a data source expires or is changed, you need to change it for the data source in **Data source credentials** too.

If there's a problem, typically it's either the gateway is offline because it couldn't sign in to Windows and start the service, or Power BI couldn't sign in to the data sources to query for updated data. If refresh fails, check the semantic model settings. If the gateway service is offline, **Status** is where you see the error. If Power BI can't sign in to the data sources, you see an error in Data source credentials.

### On-premises data gateway

If you're using the on-premises data gateway to refresh data, you don't need to supply credentials, as they're defined for the data source by the gateway administrator.

> [!NOTE]
> When connecting to on-premises SharePoint for data refresh, Power BI supports only *Anonymous*, *Basic*, and *Windows (NTLM/Kerberos)* authentication mechanisms. Power BI does not support *ADFS* or any *Forms-Based Authentication* mechanisms for data refresh of on-premises SharePoint data sources.

## Scheduled refresh

The **Refresh** section is where you define the frequency and time slots to refresh the semantic model. Some data sources don't require a gateway to be configurable for refresh, while other data sources require a gateway.

In a DirectQuery or live connection scenario, most source data isn't imported and therefore doesn't rely on scheduled refresh. However, some metadata (for example, role security updates) can still require the service to process the model. When a semantic model qualifies for performance optimization, **Refresh** can appear under the **Optimize performance** section.

Set the **Configure a refresh schedule** slider to **On** to configure the settings.

> [!NOTE]
> The target is to initiate the refresh within 15 minutes of the scheduled time slot, but a delay of up to one hour can occur if the service can't allocate the required resources sooner. Refresh can begin as early as five minutes before the scheduled refresh time.

> [!NOTE]
> Inactivity pause: After two months of inactivity, scheduled refresh on your semantic model is paused. A semantic model is considered inactive when no user has visited any dashboard or report built on it. Any view by any user (including via an app or Embedded scenario) resets the inactivity counter. When scheduled refresh is paused, the semantic model owner is emailed and the refresh schedule is displayed as **Disabled**. To resume, open any report or dashboard that uses the semantic model, then re-enable the schedule if needed.

### Refresh frequency limits

The maximum number of scheduled refreshes per day depends on the license/capacity:

* Power BI Pro: Up to 8 scheduled refreshes per day.
* Power BI Premium per user (PPU) and Premium / Fabric capacity (F SKU / EM / P / Fabric capacity): Up to 48 scheduled refreshes per day.
* Additional on-demand (manual or API) refreshes also count toward resource usage; see limits in [Data refresh](refresh-data.md#data-refresh).

For Fabric capacities, consider orchestrating complex refresh patterns with Data Factory pipelines or notebook jobs when you need dependencies or monthly cadence.

## What's supported?

> [!NOTE]
> Power BI deactivates your refresh schedule after four consecutive failures or when the service detects an unrecoverable error that requires a configuration update, such as invalid or expired credentials. It is not possible to change the consecutive failures threshold.

> [!TIP]
> Power BI does not have a monthly refresh interval option. However, you can use Power Automate (formerly Microsoft Flow) to create a custom refresh interval that occurs monthly, as described in this [blog post](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/refresh-your-power-bi-dataset-using-microsoft-flow/).

Certain semantic models are supported against different gateways for scheduled refresh.

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes refreshing data might not go as expected, typically due to an issue connected with a gateway. See these gateway troubleshooting articles for tools and known issues.
