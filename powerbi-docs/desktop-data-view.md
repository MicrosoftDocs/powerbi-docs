# Data View in Power BI Desktop
**Data View** helps you inspect, explore, and understand data in your Power BI Desktop model. It's different from how you view tables, columns, and data in **Query Editor**. With Data View, you’re looking at your data *after* it has been loaded into the model.

When you’re modeling your data, sometimes you want to see what’s actually in a table or column without creating a visual on the report canvas, often right down to the row level. This is especially true when you’re creating measures and calculated columns, or you need to identify a data type or data category.

Let’s take a closer look.

**1.** Data View icon – Click to enter Data View.

**2.** Data Grid – Shows the selected table and all columns and rows in it. Columns hidden from Report View are greyed out. You can  right-click on a column for options.

**3.** Modeling ribbon – Manage relationships, create calculations, change data type, format, data category for a column.

**4.** Formula bar – Enter DAX formulas for Measures and Calculated columns.

**5.** Search – Search for a table or column in your model.

**6.** Fields list – Select a table or column to view in the data grid.
