# Add a column from examples in Power BI Desktop
With *add column from examples* in Power Query Editor, you can add new columns to your data model simply by providing one or more example values for the new columns. You can create the new column examples from a selection, or provide input based on all existing columns in the table.

Using *add column from example* lets you quickly and easily create new columns, and is great for the following situations:

- You know the data you want in your new column, but you're not sure which transformation, or collection of transformations, will get you there.
- You already know which transformations you need, but you're not sure what to select in the UI to make them happen.
- You know all about the transformations you need using a *Custom Column* expression in *M* language, but one or more of those expressions aren't available in the UI.

Adding a column from an example is easy and straightforward. The next sections show just how easy it is.

## Add a new column from examples

To get sample data from Wikipedia, select **Get Data** > **Web** from the **Home** tab of the Power BI Desktop ribbon. 

![Get Data from Web](media/desktop-add-column-from-example/add-column-from-example_02.png)

Paste the following URL into the dialog that appears, and select **OK**: 

*https:\//wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_territories_of_the_United_States*

In the **Navigator** dialog box, select the **States of the United States of America** table, and then select **Transform Data**. The table opens in Power Query Editor.

Or, to open already-loaded data from Power BI Desktop, select **Edit Queries** from the **Home** tab of the ribbon. The data opens in Power Query Editor.

Once the sample data opens in Power Query Editor, select the **Add Column** tab on the ribbon, and then select **Column from Examples**. Select the **Column From Examples** icon itself to create the column from all existing columns, or select the drop-down arrow to choose between **From All Columns** or **From Selection**. For this walkthrough, use **From All Columns**.

## Add Column From Examples pane
When you select **Add Column** > **From Examples**, the **Add Column From Examples** pane opens at the top of the table. The new **Column 1** appears to the right of the existing columns (you may need to scroll to see them all). When you enter your example values in the blank cells of **Column 1**, Power BI creates rules and transformations to match your examples, and uses them to fill the rest of the column.

Notice that **Column From Examples** also appears as an **Applied Step** in the **Query Settings** pane. As always, Power Query Editor records your transformation steps and applies them to the query in order.

As you type your example in the new column, Power BI shows a preview of how the rest of the column will look, based on the transformations it creates. For example, if you type *Alabama* in the first row, it corresponds to the **Alabama** value in the first column of the table. As soon as you press Enter, Power BI fills in the rest of the new column based on the first column value, and names the column **Name & postal abbreviation[12] - Copy**.

Now go to the **Massachusetts[E]** row of the new column and delete the **[E]** portion of the string. Power BI detects the change and uses the example to create a transformation. Power BI describes the transformations in the **Add Column From Examples** pane, and renames the column to **Text Before Delimiter.**

As you continue to provide examples, Power Query Editor adds to the transformations. When you're satisfied, select **OK** to commit your changes. 

You can rename the new column whatever you want by double-clicking the column heading, or right-clicking it and selecting **Rename**.
