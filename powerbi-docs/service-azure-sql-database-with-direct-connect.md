# Azure SQL Database with DirectQuery

Learn how you can connect directly to Azure SQL Database and create reports that use live data. You can keep your data at the source and not in Power BI.

With DirectQuery, queries are sent back to your Azure SQL Database as you explore the data in the report view. This experience is suggested for users who are familiar with the databases and entities they connect to.

**Notes:**

* Specify the fully qualified server name when connecting (see below for more details).
* Ensure firewall rules for the database are configured to "[Allow access to Azure services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-networkaccess-overview#allow-azure-services)."
* Every action such as selecting a column or adding a filter will send a query back to the database.
* Tiles are refreshed every hour (refresh does not need to be scheduled). You can adjust how often to refresh in the Advanced settings when you connect.
* Q&A is not available for DirectQuery datasets.
* Schema changes are not picked up automatically.

These restrictions and notes may change as we continue to improve the experiences. The steps to connect are detailed below.

> [!Important]
> We have been improving our connectivity to Azure SQL Database.  For the best experience to connect to your Azure SQL Database data source, use Power BI Desktop.  Once you've built your model and report, you can publish it to the Power BI service.  The direct connector for Azure SQL Database in the Power BI service is now deprecated.

## Power BI Desktop and DirectQuery

To connect to Azure SQL Database using DirectQuery, you must use Power BI Desktop. This approach provides additional flexibility and capabilities. Reports created using Power BI Desktop can then be published to the Power BI service. You can learn more about how to connect to [Azure SQL Database using DirectQuery](desktop-use-directquery.md) within Power BI Desktop.

## Find parameter values

You can find your fully qualified server name and database name in the Azure portal.
