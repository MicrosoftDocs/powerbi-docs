# Connect the Microsoft Sustainability Calculator
Gain insights into the carbon emissions of your IT infrastructure to make more sustainable computing decisions

The Microsoft Sustainability Calculator provides new insight into carbon emissions data associated with Azure services. Those responsible for reporting on and driving sustainability within their organizations now have the ability to quantify the carbon impact of each Azure subscription, as well as see estimated carbon savings from running those workloads in Azure versus on-premises datacenters. This data may be used for greenhouse gas reporting of scope 3 emissions. Access to the Microsoft Sustainability Calculator will require your tenant ID and access key, typically available through your organization’s Azure administrator.

To use this app, you will need information from the Azure Enterprise Portal. Your enterprise’s system administrators may be able to help you obtain this information. Please review these instructions and obtain the required information prior to installing the App.
