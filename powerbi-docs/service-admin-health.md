# Track Power BI service health in Office 365

The Microsoft 365 admin center provides important tools for Power BI admins. The tools include current and historical information about service health. To access service health info, you must be in one of the following roles:

* Power BI Service Administrator

* Office 365 Global Administrator

For more info about roles, see [Administrator roles related to Power BI](service-admin-administering-power-bi-in-your-organization.md#administrator-roles-related-to-power-bi).

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://portal.office.com/adminportal).

1. From the nav pane, select **Show all** > **Health** > **Service health**. The Service health page appears:
