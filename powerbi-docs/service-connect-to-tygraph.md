# Connect to tyGraph  with Power BI
Visualize and explore your tyGraph data in Power BI with the Power BI content pack. Start by connecting to your tyGraph account and loading the dashboard, reports and dataset. The out of box content includes insights such as the Measure of Active Engagement (MAE score) and Top Contributors. Customize it further to highlight the information you care most about.  The data will be refreshed automatically according to a schedule that you set.

Connect to [tyGraph for Power BI](https://app.powerbi.com/getdata/services/tygraph).

## How to connect
1. Select **Get Data** at the bottom of the left navigation pane.

5. Provide your tyGraph key to connect. See details on finding this value below.
   
    **If you are a Yammer Verified Admin**  
    Your API key is sent to you in an email when your tyGraph account is successfully created. If you can no longer find your key, you can request a new one by sending an email to support@unlimitedviz.com. If you do not yet have a tyGraph account, you can start a trial at [http://www.tygraph.com/](http://www.tygraph.com/). 
   
    **If you are not a Yammer Verified Admin**
   
    The tyGraph content pack requires a tyGraph account created by a Yammer verified administrator. Once created, supplemental keys can be issued to users within the same organization. If your verified admin has not yet created a tyGraph account, contact them to have them do so. If they have, you can request a key by sending an email to <support@unlimitedviz.com>.

## Finding parameters
You can bring in data on all the groups you have access to, or you can choose to specify a subset. You can also create a subset of data by date. You can create multiple tyGraph dashboards to monitor specific sets of groups and/or dates. Details on these parameters are below.

**Groups**

The tyGraph API can filter data by specific group ID. These are provided to the content pack in a comma separated list. 

    Example: 2427647,946595,1154464


You can Identify the group ID for a particular group in Yammer by navigating to the feed for the group, and examining the URL.

In the above example, the Yammer Group ID is 4054844

**From Date**

The From Date allows you to restrict the earliest value for the data returned. Only data created on or after this date will be loaded into the content pack. The format of the From Date is YYYY/MM/DD. 

    Example: 2013/10/29

In the above example, all data from on or after October 29, 2013 will be loaded into the content pack. 

**To Date**
The To Date allows you to restrict the latest value for the data returned. It can be used in conjunction with the From Date to load data from a range of dates. Only data created on or before this date will be loaded into the content pack. The format of the To Date is YYYY/MM/DD. 

    Example: 2014/10/20

In the above example, all data from on or prior to October 20, 2014 will be loaded into the content pack.
