# Connect to a Google BigQuery database in Power BI Desktop
In Power BI Desktop, you can connect to a Google **BigQuery** database and use the underlying data just like any other data source in Power BI Desktop.

## Connect to Google BigQuery
To connect to a Google **BigQuery** database select **Get Data** from the **Home** ribbon in Power BI Desktop. Select **Database** from the categories on the left, and you see **Google BigQuery**.

In the **Google BigQuery** window that appears, sign in to your Google BigQuery account and select **Connect**.

When you're signed in, you see the following window indicated you've been authenticated.

Once you successfully connect, a **Navigator** window appears and displays the data available on the server, from which you can select one or multiple elements to import and use in **Power BI Desktop**.

## Considerations and Limitations
There are a few limits and considerations to keep in mind with the Google **BigQuery** connector:

* The Google BigQuery connector is available in Power BI Desktop and in the Power BI service. In the Power BI service, the connector can be accessed using the Cloud-to-Cloud connection from Power BI to Google BigQuery.

You can use Power BI with the Google BigQuery **Billing Project**. By default, Power BI uses the first project from the list returned for the user. To customize the behavior of the Billing Project when using it with Power BI, take the following steps:

 * Specifying the following option in the underlying M in the Source step, which can be customized by using **Power Query Editor** in Power BI Desktop:

    ```Source = GoogleBigQuery.Database([BillingProject="Include-Billing-Project-Id-Here"])```

## Next steps
