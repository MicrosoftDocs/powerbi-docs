# Create a new report from an existing report (copy a report)
Maybe you have a report that already connects to your dataset and has some visuals that you'd like to re-use or modify.  Why not simply copy that report as a basis for a new report?  To do that:

1. [Open a report](consumer/end-user-report-open.md).
2. From the **File** menu, select **Save As**.

3. Type a name for the new report and select **Save**.

   A Success message lets you know that the new report was saved to your current workspace in Power BI.

4. Open the **Reports** tab of your workspace and select the new report to open it. Optionally, delete visuals you don't want to keep, modify other visuals, and add new ones.
