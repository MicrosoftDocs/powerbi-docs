# Use Report Themes in Power BI Desktop
With **Report Themes** you can apply a color theme to your entire report, such as corporate colors, seasonal coloring, or other color themes. When you apply a **Report Theme**, all visuals in your report use the colors from your selected theme. A few exceptions apply, and they're described later in this article.

![Report themes](media/desktop-report-themes/report-themes_1.png)

When you apply a **Report Theme**, you need a JSON file that uses a basic structure. You can then import this JSON file into Power BI Desktop and apply it to your report. The JSON file structure, and the process of importing it, are quick and easy (just a few button clicks).

You can also customize and standardize nearly all elements. To customize, you use the JSON file, which you manually adjust in the **Formatting** pane. The goal is to give you full control over how your reports look and feel, to a granular level.

## How Report Themes work
To apply a Report Theme to a Power BI Desktop report, select from among the available built-in report themes or import a custom theme.

To select from available built-in report themes, select **Switch Theme** button from the **Home** ribbon, then select one of the included themes from the drop-down menu.

![Select a report theme](media/desktop-report-themes/report-themes_2a.png)

Your report theme is applied to the report, and you're ready to go.

### Importing Report Themes

To import a custom Report Theme, select the **Switch Theme** button from the **Home** ribbon. Then select **Import Theme** from the drop-down menu.

![Import theme](media/desktop-report-themes/report-themes_3.png)

A window appears that lets you browse to the location of the JSON theme file. Power BI Desktop looks for JSON files because JSON is the Power BI Report Theme file type. In the following image, a handful of holiday theme files are available. We'll choose a holiday theme for March.

![Holiday theme](media/desktop-report-themes/report-themes_4.png)

When the theme file has loaded successfully, Power BI Desktop lets you know.

![Theme imported successfully](media/desktop-report-themes/report-themes_5.png)

Now that we've imported a theme file, let's take a look at the simple and straightforward JSON file structure.

## Structure of a Report Theme JSON file
 When opened in an editor, the basic JSON file that we selected in the previous section (the *St Patrick's Day.json* file), looks like the following screenshot:

![St. Patrick's day JSON file](media/desktop-report-themes/report-themes_6.png)

That JSON file has the following required lines:

* **name**: The theme name, which is the only required field.

* **dataColors**: The list of hex code color codes to use for data in Power BI Desktop visuals. The list can have as many or as few colors as you want.

* **background**, **foreground**, and **tableAccent**: The colors that should be applied in various types of visuals. 
  - **foreground** applies to textbox text, KPI goal text, multi-row card text, card value text, gauge callout text, vertical slicer element text, and **table** and **matrix** total and values text. 
  - **background** applies to button fill and combo chart label background. How these colors are used depends on the specific visual style that's applied. 
  - **table** and **matrix** visuals apply these styles by default.

To apply a style to a **table** or **matrix** visual, take the following steps: 
1. Select the visual. 
2. Then, in the **Visualizations** pane, select the **Format** section.
3. Expand **Matrix style**, and then select a style from the **Style** drop-down.

![Style drop-down](media/desktop-report-themes/report-themes_7.png)

Following is the text of the *St Patrick's Day.json* file that you can use to create your own JSON file:

```json
    {
        "name": "St Patricks Day",
        "dataColors": ["#568410", "#3A6108", "#70A322", "#915203", "#D79A12", "#bb7711", "#114400", "#aacc66"],
        "background":"#FFFFFF",
        "foreground": "#3A6108",
        "tableAccent": "#568410"
    }
```

From there, you can enter your own color hex code for your selected colors.

In the JSON file, you define only the formatting that you want to adjust, and anything that's *not* specified in your JSON file simply reverts to the Power BI default settings.

The advantages of creating a JSON file are many. For example, you can specify that all charts use a font size of 12, or that certain visuals use a particular font family. Or you can turn off data labels for specific chart types.

When you use a granular JSON file, you can create a theme file that standardizes your charts and reports, making it easy for your organization's reports to be consistent.

For information about the format of the detailed JSON file, see the **Report theme JSON file format** section later in this article.

## How Report Theme colors stick to your reports
When you publish your report to the **Power BI service**, your Report Theme colors stay with it.

The **Data colors** section of the **Format** panel reflects your Report Theme. For example, after we apply the multitude of green and brown colors from the **St. Patrick's Day** theme, we select a visual. Then we go to **Format > Data colors** and see the following information:

![Visualizations](media/desktop-report-themes/report-themes_8.png)

See all that green? That's because those colors were part of the **Report Theme** that we imported and applied.

### Situations when Report Theme colors won't stick to your reports
Let's say you apply a custom color set (or individual color) to a particular data point in a visual. When you apply a Report Theme, it will *not* override that customized data point color.

Maybe you also want to manually set the color of a data point color by using the Theme colors section. The colors will *not* be updated when you apply a new Report Theme. If you want to get your default colors back, so they'll update when you apply a new Report Theme, select **Revert to default** in the **Theme colors** palette.

![Revert to default](media/desktop-report-themes/report-themes_9.png)

Also, many **Custom Visuals** won't apply to Report Themes.

## Report Theme files you can use right now
Want to get started with **Report Themes**? Here are a few ready-made Report Theme JSON files that you can download and import into your **Power BI Desktop** report. We've also included an image of the Report Theme that's applied to the report in this article.

* The [theme](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=843924) used in the [blog post](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/power-bi-desktop-march-feature-summary/) that announced the first release of **Report Themes**, called [*waveform.json*](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=843924).

  ![The waverform.json theme](media/desktop-report-themes/report-themes_10.png)

* The [theme that's easier to read for the visually impaired](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=843923) than the default color theme. It's called [*ColorblindSafe-Longer.json*](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=843923).

  ![The ColorblindSafe-Longer.json theme.](media/desktop-report-themes/report-themes_11.png)

* A group of [Power View themes](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=843925) wrapped in a zip file, including one called [*Apothecary.json*](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=843925), which is shown below.

  ![The Apothecary.json theme](media/desktop-report-themes/report-themes_12.png)

* Lastly, here's the *Valentine's Day* theme.

  ![The Valentine's Day theme](media/desktop-report-themes/report-themes_13.png)

Rather than give you a download, we've provided the code for the Valentine's day JSON file:

```json
    {
        "name": "Valentine's Day",
        "dataColors": ["#990011", "#cc1144", "#ee7799", "#eebbcc", "#cc4477", "#cc5555", "#882222", "#A30E33"],
        "background":"#FFFFFF",
        "foreground": "#ee7799",
        "tableAccent": "#990011"
    }
```

**Report Themes** can make your Power BI Desktop reports a colorful reflection of you, your organization, or even the current season or holiday. 

Here are a few more report themes you can use as starting points:

* [Sunflower-twilight](https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Themes-Gallery/Sunflower-Twilight/m-p/140749)
* [Plum](https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Themes-Gallery/Plum/m-p/140711)
* [Autumn](https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Themes-Gallery/Autumn/m-p/140746)
* [High contrast](https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Themes-Gallery/Color-Blind-Friendly/m-p/140597)

## Report theme JSON file format
The basic JSON file has five required lines:

* **name**: The theme name, which is the only required field.
* **dataColors**: The list of hex code color codes to use for data in Power BI Desktop visuals. The list can have as many or as few colors as you want.
* **background**, **foreground**, and **tableAccent**: The colors that should be applied in various types of visuals. The **foreground** applies to textbox text, KPI goal text, multi-row card text, card value text, gauge callout text, vertical slicer element text, and **table** and **matrix** total and values text. The **background** applies to button fill and combo chart label background. How these colors are used depends on the specific visual style that's applied. The **table** and **matrix** visuals apply these styles by default.

To create an extended-format JSON file, with more detailed and granular control over formatting, you also need to add a **visualStyles** section to the JSON file. You nest the formatting specifics in the  **visualStyles** section. The  **visualStyles** section looks similar to the following format:

    visualStyles: {
        visualName: {
            styleName: {
                cardName: [{
                    propertyName: propertyValue
                }]
            }
        }
    }

For the **visualName** and **cardName** sections,   use a specific visual and cardName. Use an asterisk ("\*") if you want that setting to apply to all visuals or cards that have a property for a specific visual. You can also use the asterisk ("\*") when you want to apply a setting globally in your report, such as a font size or specific font family for the visuals.

> [!NOTE]
> You only need to specify the formatting elements you want to adjust. Any formatting elements that are not included in the JSON file simply revert to their default values and settings.
> 
> 

### JSON file element definitions
The tables in this section define visual names (*visualName*), card names (*cardName*), and the enumerations that are necessary to create your JSON file.

When you're using *dateTime*, the date must be an ISO date in single quotes, with datetime at the beginning. Following is an example:

    “datetime’2011-10-05T14:48:00.000Z’”

Booleans are either *true* or *false*. Strings must be in double quotes, as in "this is a string".
