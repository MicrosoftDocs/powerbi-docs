# Use report themes in Power BI Desktop
With Power BI Desktop *report themes*, you can apply design changes to your entire report, such as using corporate colors, changing icon sets, or applying new default visual formatting. When you apply a report theme, all visuals in your report use the colors and formatting from your selected theme. A few exceptions apply, which are described later in this article.

![Report themes](media/desktop-report-themes/report-themes-1a.png)

There are two types of report themes, built-in report themes and custom report theme files:

- Built-in report themes provide different kinds of predefined color schemes that are installed with Power BI Desktop. You select built-in report themes directly from the Power BI Desktop menu. 

- Custom report theme files are report themes that are created in JSON files that define their basic structure. To apply a custom report theme, you import its JSON file into Power BI Desktop and apply it to your report.

You can customize and standardize nearly all the elements that are listed in the **Format** section of the **Visualizations** pane, either through customizations made directly in Power BI Desktop, or through a report theme JSON file. The goal is to give you full control over your report's look and feel, on a granular level.

## How report themes work
To apply a report theme to a Power BI Desktop report, select from among the available built-in report themes, or create or import a custom theme file.

### Built-in report themes

To select from the available built-in report themes: 

1. Select **Switch Theme** from the **Home** ribbon. 

   ![Select a report theme](media/desktop-report-themes/report-themes-2a.png)

2. Select one of the included themes from the drop-down menu.

   Your report theme is now applied to the report.

The following table shows the available built-in report themes.

| Built-in report theme	| Default color sequence 	|
|------	|----------	|
| Default 	| ![Default](media/desktop-report-themes/report-themes-color-scheme-default.png)|
| Highrise 	| ![Highrise](media/desktop-report-themes/report-themes-color-scheme-highrise.png)|

### Import custom report theme files

To import a custom report theme file: 

1. Select **Switch Theme** from the **Home** ribbon, then select **Import Theme** from the drop-down menu. 

   ![Import theme](media/desktop-report-themes/report-themes-3a.png)

   A window appears that lets you browse to the location of the JSON theme file. 

2. In the following image, a handful of holiday theme files are available. We'll choose a holiday theme for March, *St Patricks Day.json*.

   ![Holiday theme](media/desktop-report-themes/report-themes_4.png)

   When the theme file has loaded successfully, Power BI Desktop displays a success message.

There are two ways to customize report themes in Power BI Desktop. Let's take a look at each, in turn.

## Customize report themes (preview)

Beginning with the December 2019 release of Power BI Desktop, there are now two ways to customize a report theme:

* [Create and customize a theme in Power BI Desktop (preview)](#create-and-customize-a-theme-in-power-bi-desktop-preview)
* [Create and customize a custom report theme JSON file](#introduction-to-report-theme-json-files)

### Create and customize a theme in Power BI Desktop (preview)

As of the December 2019 release of Power BI Desktop, the ability to customize a theme directly in Power BI Desktop is now available as a preview.

To customize a theme directly in Power BI Desktop: 

1. Select **File** > **Options and settings** > **Options**. 

2. In the **Preview features** section, select **Customize current theme**, and then select **OK**.

   ![Enable customized themes](media/desktop-report-themes/report-themes_5a.png)

   You might be prompted to restart Power BI Desktop for the preview feature to be enabled. After you restart, you can begin customizing the currently applied theme. 

3. From the **Home** ribbon, select **Switch theme** > **Customize current theme**. 

   A dialog box appears, which displays the ways to customize an existing theme.

   ![Customize the theme](media/desktop-report-themes/report-themes_5b.png)

4. If you like an existing theme and want to make a few adjustments, select the theme and then select **Customize current theme**. 

   ![Customize the current theme](media/desktop-report-themes/report-themes_5c.png)

Customizable theme settings are found in the following categories, reflected in the **Customize theme** window:

* **Name and colors**: Theme name and color settings include theme colors, sentiment colors, divergent colors.
* **Text**: Text settings include font family, size, and color, as well as axis titles, colors, cards and KPIs, and tab headers.
* **Visuals**: Visual element settings include background, border, header, and tooltips.
* **Page**: Page element settings include wallpaper and background.
* **Filter pane**: Filter pane settings include background color, transparency, font and icon color, size, filter cards.

After you make your changes, select **Apply and save** to save your theme. Your theme can now be used in the current report, and exported. 

Customizing the current theme in this way makes quick and easy, visual work of customizing themes. However, you can make finer adjustments to themes, which require modifying the theme's [JSON file](#report-theme-json-file-format).

> [!TIP]
> You can customize most theme elements by using the visual elements in the **Customize theme** window. Then, you can optionally export the JSON file and make fine-tuned adjustments manually by modifying the settings in the JSON file. You can rename that fine-tuned JSON file and later import it.

## Introduction to report theme JSON files
 When you open the basic JSON file mentioned in the previous section (St Patricks Day.json), it appears as follows:

 ```json
    {
        "name": "St Patrick's Day",
        "dataColors": ["#568410", "#3A6108", "#70A322", "#915203", "#D79A12", "#bb7711", "#114400", "#aacc66"],
        "background":"#FFFFFF",
        "foreground": "#3A6108",
        "tableAccent": "#568410"
    }
```

This report theme JSON file has the following lines:

* **name**: The report theme name. This field is the only required field.

* **dataColors**: The list of color hexadecimal codes to use for data in Power BI Desktop visuals. This list can have as many or as few colors as you want.

* **background**, **foreground**, and **tableAccent**: Color classes. Color classes enable you to set many colors in your report at once. 

You can use this JSON file as a basis to create your own custom report theme file to import. If you want to adjust only the basic colors of your report, change the name and hex codes in the file.

In a report theme JSON file, you define only the formatting that you want to change. Whatever you don't specify in the JSON file reverts to the Power BI Desktop default settings.

The advantages of creating a JSON file are many. For example, you can specify that all charts use a font size of 12, that certain visuals use a particular font family, or that data labels are turned off for specific chart types. By using a JSON file, you can create a report theme file that standardizes your charts and reports, making it easy for your organization's reports to be consistent.

For more information about the format of the JSON file, see [Report theme JSON file format](#report-theme-json-file-format).

## How report theme colors stick with your reports
When you publish your report to the Power BI service, your report theme colors stay with it. The **Data colors** section of the **Format** panel reflects your report theme. 

To view the available colors in a report theme:

1. Select a visual. 

2. From the **Format** section of the **Visualization** pane, select **Data colors**.
 
3. Select the drop-down of an item to view the **Theme colors** information of the report theme.

   ![Theme colors](media/desktop-report-themes/report-themes_8.png)

In our example, after you apply the multitude of green and brown colors from the St. Patrick's Day report theme, view the theme colors. See all that green? That's because those colors were part of the report theme that we imported and applied.

The colors in the color palette are relative to the current theme. For example, suppose you select the third color of the top row for a data point. Later, if you change to a different theme, that data point’s color updates automatically to the third color of the top row in the new theme, just as you’d see when changing themes in Microsoft Office.

### Situations when report theme colors won't stick to your reports
Suppose you apply a custom color set (or individual color) to a particular data point in a visual by using the **Custom color** option in the color picker. When you apply a report theme, it does *not* override that customized data point color.

Or, suppose you want to manually set the color of a data point color by using the **Theme colors** section. When you apply a new report theme, those colors are *not* updated. To get your default colors back, so they'll update when you apply a new report theme, select **Revert to default**, or select a color from the **Theme colors** palette in the color picker.

![Revert to default](media/desktop-report-themes/report-themes_9.png)

Many custom visuals won't apply to report themes.

Report themes can make your Power BI Desktop reports a colorful reflection of you, your organization, or even the current season or holiday. 


## Export report themes (preview)

Beginning with the December 2019 release of Power BI Desktop, you can now have the option of exporting the currently applied report theme directly from Power BI Desktop to a JSON file. After you export a report theme, you can then reuse it in your own reports. This option  lets you export the JSON file for most of the built-in themes. The only exceptions are the base themes, Classic and Default, which other themes build upon when imported. 

To export the currently applied theme from Power BI Desktop: 

1. Select **File** > **Options and settings** > **Options**. 

2. In the **Preview features** section, select **Customize current theme**, and then select **OK**.

   You might be prompted to restart Power BI Desktop for the preview feature to be enabled. After you restart, you can begin exporting the currently applied theme. 

3.  From the **Home** ribbon, select **Switch theme** > **Export current theme**. 

4. From the **Save As** dialog box, browse to a directory in which to save the JSON file, and then select **Save**.

## Report theme JSON file format
At its most basic level, the theme JSON file has only one required line: **name**. 

```json
    {
        "name": "Custom Theme",
    }
```

Other than **name**, everything else is optional, which means you're free to only add the properties you specifically want to format to the theme file, and continue to use Power BI’s defaults for the rest. 

Under **name**, you can add the following basic data color-related properties: 

* **dataColors**: The list of color hexadecimal codes to use for data in Power BI Desktop visuals. This list can have as many or as few colors as you want. Once all colors from this list have been used, if the visual still needs more colors, it reverts back to using Power BI’s default color palette. 
* **good**, **neutral**, **bad**: These properties set the status colors used by the waterfall chart and the KPI visual.
* **maximum**, **center**, **minimum**, **null**: These colors set the various gradient colors in the conditional formatting dialog box.  

A basic theme that defines these colors might appear as follows:

```json
    {
        "name": "Custom Theme",
	      "dataColors": [
        		"#118DFF",
        		"#12239E", 
        		"#E66C37", 
        		"#6B007B", 
        		"#E044A7",
        		"#744EC2", 
        		"#D9B300", 
        		"#D64550",
        		"#197278", 
        		"#1AAB40"
	],
    	"good": "#1AAB40",
    	"neutral": "#D9B300",
    	"bad": "#D64554",
    	"maximum": "#118DFF",
    	"center": "#D9B300",
    	"minimum": "#DEEFFF",
    	"null": "#FF7F48"
    }
```

Next, you can add various color classes, such as **background** and **foreground**. Color classes let you set many colors throughout your report in one line, by grouping similar visual properties that generally have the same color together. 

The following table shows the six color classes you can format.

|Color class  |What it formats  |
|---------|---------|
|**foreground**	| Labels background color (when outside data points) <br> Trend line color <br>  Textbox default color <br> Table and matrix values and totals font colors Data bars axis color <br> Card data labels <br> Gauge callout value color <br> KPI goal color <br>  KPI text color <br> Slicer item color (when in focus mode)  <br> Slicer dropdown item font color <br> Slicer numeric input font color <br> Slicer header font color <br> Scatter chart ratio line color <br> Line chart forecast line color <br> Map leader line color <br> Filter pane and card text color|
|**foregroundNeutralSecondary** |Label colors  <br> Legend label color <br> Axis label color <br> Table and matrix header font color <br> Gauge target and target leader line color <br>  KPI trend axis color <br> Slicer slider color <br> Slicer item font color <br> Slicer outline color <br> Line chart hover color <br> Multi-row card title color <br> Ribbon chart stroke color <br> Shape map border color <br> Button text font color <br> Button icon line color <br> Button outline color |
| **foregroundNeutralTertiary** | legend dimmed color <br> Card category label color <br> Multi-row card category labels color <br> Mulit-row card bar color <br> Funnel chart conversion rate stroke color 
| **backgroundLight** | Axis gridline color <br> Table and matrix grid color <br> Slicer header background color (when in focus mode)  <br> Multi-row card outline color  <br> Shape fill color <br> Gauge arc background color <br> Applied filter card background color <br> |
**backgroundNeutral** | Table and matrix grid outline color <br> Shape map default color <br> Ribbon chart ribbon fill color (when match series option is turned off) |
**background** | Labels background color (when inside data points) <br> Slicer dropdown items background color  <br> Donut chart stroke color <br> Treemap stroke color <br> Combo chart background color <br> Button fill color <br> Filter pane and available  filter card background color |
**tableAccent** | Overrides table and matrix grid outline color when present |


Here’s a sample theme that sets the color classes:

```json
    {
        "name": "Custom Theme",
   	    "foreground": "#252423",
    	  "foregroundNeutralSecondary": "#605E5C",
    	  "foregroundNeutralTertiary": "#B3B0AD",
   	    "background": "#FFFFFF",
    	  "backgroundLight": "#F3F2F1",
    	  "backgroundNeutral": "#C8C6C4",
   	    "tableAccent": "#118DFF"
    }
```

Next up, you can add text classes to your JSON file. Text classes are similar to color classes, but are designed to allow you to update the font size, color, and family for groups of text across your report. There are 12 text classes, but you need to set only four classes, called *primary classes*, to change all of the text formatting in your report. Other text classes, considered *secondary classes*, automatically inherit or derive their properties from their associated primary classes. Often, a secondary class derives a lighter shade of text color, or a percentage large or smaller text size compared to the primary class. 

Take the **label** class as an example. The default formatting for the **label** class is Segoe UI, #252423 (a dark grey color), and 12 point. This class is used to format the values in the table and matrix. Typically, the totals in a table or matrix have similar formatting, but are bolded with the **bold label** class so they stand out. However, you don't need to specify that class in the theme JSON; Power BI does so automatically. Later, if you decide to specify labels that have a 14-point font in your theme, you don’t need to also update the **bold label** class, because it inherits text formatting from the **label** class. 

The following table shows the following information:
* Each of the four primary text classes, what it formats, and its default settings
* Each secondary class, what it formats, and its default setting that's unique compared to the primary class


|Primary class  |Secondary classes  |JSON class name  |Settings  |Associated visual objects  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Callout	| N/A	| callout | DIN <br> #252423 <br> 45pt |Card data labels <br> KPI indicators|
|Header|N/A|header|Segoe UI Semibold <br> #252423 <br> 12pt	|Key influencers headers |
| Title || title	|DIN <br> #252423 <br> 12pt |Category axis title <br> Value axis title <br> Multi-row card title * <br> Slicer header|
|-| Large title	| largeTitle	|14pt	|Visual title |
|Label ||label |Segoe UI<br>#252423<br>10pt |Table and matrix column headers <br> Matrix row headers<br>Table and matrix grid<br>Table and matrix values |
|-|Semibold |semiboldLabel| Segoe UI Semibold	| Key influencers profile text
|-|Large	|largeLabel	|12pt	| Multi-row card data labels |
|-|Small	|smallLabel	|9pt	|Reference line labels * <br>Slicer date range labels<br> Slicer numeric input text style<br>Slicer search box<br>Key influencers influencer text|
|-|Light	|lightLabel	|#605E5C	|Legend text<br>Button text<br>Category Axis labels<br>Funnel chart data labels<br>Funnel chart conversion rate labels<br>Gauge target<br>Scatter chart category label<br>Slicer items|
|-|Bold	|boldLabel	|Segoe UI Bold	|Matrix subtotals<br>Matrix grand totals<br>Table totals |
|-|Large and Light	|largeLightLabel	|#605E5C<br>12pt	|Card category labels<br>Gauge labels<br>Multi-row card category labels |
|-|Small and Light	|smallLightLabel	|#605E5C<br>9pt	|Data labels<br>Value axis labels|


Because secondary classes inherit from the primary classes, you don't need to set them in your theme file. However, if you don’t like the inheritance rules (for example, if you don’t want your totals to be a bolded version of the values in a table), you can explicitly format the secondary classes in the theme file, just like you can format the primary classes.

Here’s an example theme that sets only the primary text classes: 

```json
    {
        	"name": "Custom Theme",
   	      "textClasses": {
        		"callout": {
            		"fontSize": 45,
            		"fontFace": "wf_standard-font",
            		"color": "#252423"
        		},
        		"title": {
            		"fontSize": 12,
            		"fontFace": "wf_standard-font",
            		"color": "#252423"
        		},
        		"header": {
            		"fontSize": 12,
            		"fontFace": "Segoe UI Semibold",
            		"color": "#252423"
        		},
        		"label": {
            		"fontSize": 10,
            		"fontFace": "Segoe UI",
            		"color": "#252423"
        		}
    	}    
    }
```

Lastly, to create an extended-format JSON file, with more detailed and granular control over all visual formatting, add a **visualStyles** section to the JSON file to nest the formatting specifics. Here's an example of the **visualStyles** section:

    visualStyles: {
        visualName: {
            styleName: {
                cardName: [{
                    propertyName: propertyValue
                }]
            }
        }
    }

For the **visualName** and **cardName** sections, use a specific visual and card name. Currently, the **styleName** is always an asterisk (*), but in a future release you’ll be able to create different styles for your visuals and give them names (similar to the table and matrix style feature). **propertyName** is the name of the formatting option and **propertyValue** is the value for that formatting option.  

For **visualName** and **cardName**, use an asterisk in quotes if you want that setting to apply to all visuals or cards that have a property. If you use an asterisk for both the visual and card name, you're effectively applying a setting globally in your report, such as a font size or specific font family for all text across all visuals.

Here’s an example that sets a few properties through the visual styles: 

```json
{  
   "name":"Custom Theme",
   "visualStyles":{  
      "*":{  
         "*":{  
            "*":[{  
                  "wordWrap":true
            }],
            "categoryAxis":[{
                  "gridlineStyle":"dotted"
            }],
            "filterCard":[{  
                  "$id":"Applied",
                  "foregroundColor":{"solid":{"color":"#252423"}}
               },
               {  
                  "$id":"Available",
                  "border":true
            }]
         }
      },
      "scatterChart":{  
         "*":{  
            "bubbles":[{  
                  "bubbleSize":-10
            }]
         }
      }
   }
}
```

This example makes the following settings:

* Turns on word wrap everywhere
* Sets the gridline style to dotted for all visuals with a category axis
* Sets some formatting for the available and applied filter cards (note the format using “$id” to set the different versions of the filter cards)
* Sets the bubble size for scatter charts to -10.


> [!NOTE]
> You need only specify the formatting elements you want to adjust. Any formatting elements that aren't included in the JSON file revert to their default values and settings.

### Properties within each card
The following section defines the properties within each card. The card name is followed by each property name. For each property: the name you see if the formatting pane is displayed, a description of what the formatting option does, and the type of the formatting option. This approach lets you know what kind of values you can use in your theme file. 

When you're using **dateTime**, the date must be an ISO date in single quotes, with datetime at the beginning. See the following example:

    “datetime’2011-10-05T14:48:00.000Z’”

Booleans are either true or false. Strings must be in double quotes, as in "this is a string". Numbers are just the value itself, not in quotes.

Colors use the following format, where your custom hexadecimal code replaces “FFFFFF” is in the following example:  

    { "solid": { "color": "#FFFFFF" } }

An enumeration, most commonly used for drop-down formatting options, means it can be set to any of the options seen in the pane, for example "RightCenter" for legend position or "Data value, percent of total" for pie data label. The enumeration options are shown below the property list.

## Limitations and considerations

If you're using one of our original themes, the “Classic” theme, or a custom theme that you imported on top of one of these, the text section of the theme dialog box isn't available for configuring.

Built-in themes that are affected by this limitation include the following themes:
* Classic
* City park
* Classroom
* Colorblind safe
* Electric
* High contrast
* Sunset
* Twilight

If you're using one of the affected themes and you don’t need to modify the text settings, you can safely use the other tabs of the dialog box with no issues. However, if you want to use the text classes with one of the affected themes, you have a couple options:

- The quickest and easiest way to enable the text classes is to select the Default theme options.
- If you want to keep your current custom theme, to enable the text tab:
  1. Export your current theme.
  1. Select the default theme.
  1. Import the custom theme you exported in the first step.

The text in your report will look different, but you will be able to access the text tab in the theme dialog box.
