# The new filter experience in Power BI reports (Preview)

Filters in Power BI have new functionality and a new design. When you opt in to the new filter experience, you can format the Filters pane to look like the rest of the report. You can lock and even hide filters. When designing your report, you no longer see the old Filters pane at all in the Visualizations pane. You do all your filter editing and formatting in a single Filters pane.

> [!NOTE]
> The new filter experience is in preview. New builds may override formatting you've already set.

As a report designer, here's what you can do in the new single Filters pane:

- Add and remove fields to filter on. 
- Change the filter state.
- Format and customize the Filters pane so that it feels part of your report.
- Define whether the Filters pane is open or collapsed by default when a consumer opens the report.
- Hide the entire Filters pane or specific filters that you don’t want report consumers to see.
- Control and even bookmark the visibility, open, and collapsed state of the new Filters pane.
- Lock filters that you don’t want consumers to edit.

With the new filter experience, report consumers can also hover over any visual to see a read-only list of all the filters or slicers affecting that visual.

## Turn on the new filter experience 

You enable the new experience in Power BI Desktop. Then you can modify filters there or in the Power BI service (https://app.powerbi.com). Because this new filter experience is in Preview, you must first enable it in Power BI Desktop. If you start by creating a report in the Power BI service, it can't have the new filters.

### Turn on new filters for all new reports

1. In Power BI Desktop, select **File** > **Options and Settings** > **Options** > **Preview Features**, then select the **New filter experience** checkbox. 
2. Restart Power BI Desktop to see the new filter experience in all new reports.

After you restart Power BI Desktop, it's enabled by default for all new reports you create.  

### Turn on new filters for an existing report

You can also enable the new filters for existing reports.

1. In Power BI Desktop in an existing report, select **File** > **Options and Settings** > **Options**
2. In the left navigation bar, under **Current file**, select **Report settings**.
3. Under **Filtering experience**, select **Enable the updated filter pane, and show filters in the visual header for this report**.

## View filters for a visual in Reading mode

In Reading mode, hover over the filter icon for a visual to see a pop-up with all the filters, slicers, and so on, affecting that visual. The formatting of the pop-up is the same as the Filters pane formatting. 

![Filters affecting a visual](media/power-bi-report-filter-preview/power-bi-filter-per-visual.png)

Here are the types of filters this view shows: 
- Basic filters
- Slicers
- Cross-highlighting 
- Cross-filtering
- Advanced filters
- Top N filters
- Relative Date filters
- Sync-slicers
- Include/Exclude filters
- Filters passed through a URL

## Build the new Filters pane

After you enable the new Filters pane, you see it to the right of the report page, formatted by default based on your current report settings. You use the new Filters pane to configure which filters to include, and to update existing filters in the new pane. The new Filters pane shows you what your report consumers will see when you publish your report. 

1. By default, your report consumers can see the Filters pane. If you don't want them to see it, select the eye icon next to **Filters**.

    ![Power BI filter eye icon](media/power-bi-report-filter-preview/power-bi-filter-eye.png)

2. To start building your new Filters pane, drag fields of interest into the new Filters pane either as visual, page, or report level filters.

When you add a visual to a report canvas, Power BI automatically adds a filter to the FIlters pane for each field in the visual. 

## Lock or hide filters

You can lock or hide individual filter cards. If you lock a filter, your report consumers can see but not change it. If you hide it, they can't even see it. Hiding filter cards is typically useful if you need to hide data cleanup filters that exclude nulls or unexpected values. 

- In the new Filters pane, select or clear the **Lock filter** or **Hide filter** icons in a filter card.

   ![Hide or lock filters](media/power-bi-report-filter-preview/power-bi-filter-lock-hide.png)

As you turn these settings on and off in the new Filters pane, you see the changes reflected in the report. Hidden filters don't show up in the filter pop-up for a visual.

You can also configure the new Filters pane state to flow with your report bookmarks. The pane’s open, close, and visibility state are all bookmarkable.
 
## Format the new Filters pane

A big part of this new experience is that you can format the Filters pane to match the look and feel of your report. You can format the Filters pane differently for each page in the report. Here are elements you can format: 

- Background color
- Background transparency
- Border on or off
- Border color
- Title and header font, color, and text size

You can also format these elements for filter cards, depending on if they're applied (set to something) or available (cleared): 

- Background color
- Background transparency
- Border: on or off
- Border color
- Font, color, and text size
- Input box color

### Format the Filters pane and cards

1. In the report, click the report itself, or the background (*wallpaper*), then in the **Visualizations** pane, select **Format**. 
    You see options for formatting the report page, the wallpaper, and also the Filters pane and Filter cards.

    ![Select the Format icon](media/power-bi-report-filter-preview/power-bi-filter-format.png)    

1. Expand **Filter pane** to set color for the background, icon, and left border, to complement the report page.

    ![Expand Filter pane](media/power-bi-report-filter-preview/power-bi-filter-format-pane-font.png)

1. Expand **Filter cards** to set the **Available** and **Applied** color and border. If you make available and applied cards different colors, it's obvious which filters are applied.

## Theming for filter pane
You can now modify the default settings of the filter pane with the theme file. Here’s a sample theme snippet to get you started:

 
```
"outspacePane": [{ 

"backgroundColor": {"solid": {"color": "#0000ff"}}, 

"foregroundColor": {"solid": {"color": "#00ff00"}}, 

"transparency": 50, 

"titleSize": 35, 

"headerSize": 8, 

"fontFamily": "Georgia", 

"border": true, 

"borderColor": {"solid": {"color": "#ff0000"}} 

}], 

"filterCard": [ 

{ 

"$id": "Applied", 

"transparency": 0, 

"backgroundColor": {"solid": {"color": "#ff0000"}}, 

"foregroundColor": {"solid": {"color": "#45f442"}}, 

"textSize": 30, 

"fontFamily": "Arial", 

"border": true, 

"borderColor": {"solid": {"color": "#ffffff"}}, 

"inputBoxColor": {"solid": {"color": "#C8C8C8"}} 

}, 

{ 

"$id": "Available", 

"transparency": 40, 

"backgroundColor": {"solid": {"color": "#00ff00"}}, 

"foregroundColor": {"solid": {"color": "#ffffff"}}, 

"textSize": 10, 

"fontFamily": "Times New Roman", 

"border": true, 

"borderColor": {"solid": {"color": "#123456"}}, 

"inputBoxColor": {"solid": {"color": "#777777"}} 

}] 
```

## Sort the filter pane

Custom sort functionality is part of the new filter pane experience. Report creators can drag and drop filters to rearrange them in the order they desire.

![Rearrange filter sort order](media/power-bi-report-filter-preview/power-bi-filter-sort.gif)

The default sort order is alphabetical for filters. To start custom sort mode, just drag any filter to a new position. You can only sort filters within the level they apply to -- for example, a visual-level, page-level, or report-level filter.

## Improved Filters pane accessibility

We've improved the keyboard navigation for the new Filters pane. You can tab through every part of the Filters pane and use the context key on your keyboard or Shift+F10 to open the context menu.

![Filters pane accessibility](media/power-bi-report-filter-preview/power-bi-filter-accessible.png)

## Rename filters
When you're editing the Filters pane, you can double-click the title to edit it. Renaming is useful if you want to update the filter card to make more sense for your end users. Keep in mind renaming the filter card does *not* rename the display name of the field in the fields list. It just changes the display name used in the filter card.

## Restrict changes to filter type

Under the Filtering experience section of the report settings you have an option to control if users can change the filter type.
