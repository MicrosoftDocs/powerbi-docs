# How administrators can manage the Power BI Desktop sign-in form
The first time Power BI Desktop is launched, a sign-in form is displayed. Information can be filled in, or sign in to Power BI to continue. Administrators manage this form by using a registry key.

Administrators use the following registry key to disable the sign-in form. This can also be pushed to an entire organization by using global policies.

```
Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Power BI Desktop
valueName: ShowLeadGenDialog
```

A value of 0 will disable the dialog.
