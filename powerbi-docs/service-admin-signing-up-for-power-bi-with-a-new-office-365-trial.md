# Signing up for Power BI with a new Office 365 Trial

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gbSuFST-Nx4?showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This article describes an alternative way to sign up for Power BI, using an Office 365 trial. If you're having problems signing up for Power BI with your work email address, first make sure it's an [email address that can be used with Power BI](service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi.md#supported-email-addresses). If that's not successful, try signing up for an Office 365 trial first and then signing up for Power BI. You'll be able to use Power BI even after the Office 365 trial expires.

1. Sign up for an Office 365 trial [on the Office 365 web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=403802).

1. When you complete that signup process, you're given a new sign-in name that looks like you@yourcompany.onmicrosoft.com. This is the sign-in you'll use with Power BI.

1. Sign up for Power BI [using this link](https://app.powerbi.com/signupredirect?pbi_source=web). If you're prompted, sign in using the sign-in name and password you selected for Office 365 in the previous step.

1. That's it! When you're finished, you'll be redirected to Power BI. If you have any issues signing in with the new account, try using a private browser session.

## Important considerations

By using this signup method, you are creating a new organizational tenant and you'll become the administrator of the tenant. For more information, see [What is Power BI administration?](service-admin-administering-power-bi-in-your-organization.md). You can add new users to your tenant, then share with them, as described in the [Office 365 admin documentation](https://support.office.com/en-sg/article/Add-users-individually-to-Office-365---Admin-Help-1970f7d6-03b5-442f-b385-5880b9c256ec?ui=en-US&rs=en-SG&ad=SG).
