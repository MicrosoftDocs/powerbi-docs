# Connect to Zendesk with Power BI
The Zendesk content pack offers a Power BI dashboard and a set of Power BI reports that provide insights about your ticket volumes and agent performance. You can use the dashboard and reports provided, or customize them to highlight the information you care most about.  The data will be refreshed automatically once a day. 

Connect to the [Zendesk content pack](https://app.powerbi.com/getdata/services/zendesk) or read more about the [Zendesk integration](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/integrations/zendesk) with Power BI.

>[!NOTE]
>A Zendesk Admin account is required to connect. More details on [requirements](#Requirements) below.
