# Supplier Quality Analysis sample for Power BI: Take a tour

This industry sample dashboard and underlying report focus on one of the typical supply chain challenges: supplier quality analysis. Two primary metrics are at play in this analysis: total number of defects and the total downtime that these defects caused. 

This sample has two main objectives:

* Understand who the best and worst suppliers are, with respect to quality.
* Identify which plants do a better job finding and rejecting defects, to minimize downtime.

![Dashboard for the Supplier Quality Analysis sample](media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier1.png)

This sample is part of a series that shows how you can use Power BI with business-oriented data, reports, and dashboards. It was created by [obviEnce](https://www.obvience.com/) with real data, which has been anonymized. The data is available in several formats: content pack, .pbix Power BI Desktop file, or Excel workbook. See [Samples for Power BI](sample-datasets.md). 

This tutorial explores the Supplier Quality Analysis sample content pack in the Power BI service. Because the report experience is similar in Power BI Desktop and in the service, you can also follow along by using the sample .pbix file in Power BI Desktop. 

You don't need a Power BI license to explore the samples in Power BI Desktop. If you don't have a Power BI Pro license, you can save the sample to your My Workspace in the Power BI service.

## Downtime caused by defective materials
Let’s analyze the downtime caused by defective materials and see which vendors are responsible.  

1. On the dashboard, select the **Total Defect Quantity** or the **Total Downtime Minutes** tile.

   ![Select tile to open report](media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier2.png)  

   The Supplier Quality Analysis Sample report opens to the **Downtime Analysis** page.

   Notice we have 33 million defective pieces, causing a total downtime of 77,000 minutes. Although some materials have fewer defective pieces, they can cause delays, which result in more downtime. Let’s explore them on the report page.  
2. If we look at the **Total Downtime Minutes** line in the **Defects and Downtime (min) by Material Type** combo chart, we can see that corrugate materials cause the most downtime.  
3. Select the **Corrugate** column to see which plants are affected most by this defect and which vendor is responsible.  

   ![Select Corrugate column](media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier3.png)  
4. In the **Downtime (min) by Plant** map, select individual plants in turn to see which vendor or material is responsible for the downtime at that plant.

### Which are the worst suppliers?
 We want to find the worst eight suppliers and determine what percentage of the downtime they're responsible for creating. We can do so by changing the **Downtime (min) by Vendor** area chart to a treemap.  

1. On the **Downtime Analysis** page of the report, select **Edit report** in the upper-left corner.  
2. Select the **Downtime (min) by Vendor** area chart, and in the **Visualizations** pane, select the **Treemap** icon.  

   ![Select treemap icon](media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier4.png)  

    The treemap automatically sets the **Vendor** field as the **Group**.  

    ![Downtime (min) by Vendor treemap](media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier5.png)  

   From this treemap, we can see the top eight vendors are the eight blocks on the left of the treemap. We can also see they account for about 50% of all downtime minutes.  
3. Select **Supplier Quality Analysis Sample** in the top nav pane to return to the dashboard.

### Comparing plants
Now let’s explore which plant does a better job managing defective material, resulting in less downtime.  

1. On the dashboard, select the **Total Defect Reports by Plant, Defect Type** map tile.      

   ![Total Defect Reports by Plant, Defect Type tile](media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier6.png)  

   The report opens to the **Supplier Quality Analysis** page.  

2. In the legend of the **Total Defect Reports by Plant and Defect Type**, select the **Impact** circle.  

    ![Select Impact](media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier7.png)  

    Notice in the bubble chart that **Logistics** is the most troublesome category. It’s the largest in terms of total defect quantity, defect reports, and downtime minutes. Let’s explore this category more.  
3. Select the **Logistics** bubble in the bubble chart and observe the plants in Springfield and Naperville, IL. Naperville seems to be doing a much better job of managing defective supplies as it has a high number of rejects and few impacts, compared to Springfield’s large number for impacts.  

   ![Select Logistics](media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier8.png)  
4. Select **Supplier Quality Analysis Sample** in the top nav pane to return to the dashboard.

## Which material type is best managed?
The best managed material type is the one with lowest downtime or no impact, regardless of defect quantity.

1. In the dashboard, look at the **Total Defect Quantity by Material Type, Defect Type** tile.

   ![Total Defect Quantity by Material Type, Defect Type tile](media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier9.png)

   Notice that although **Raw Materials** material type has many total defects, most of those defects are either rejected or have no impact.

   Let’s verify that this material type doesn't cause much downtime, despite high defect quantity.

2. In the dashboard, look at the **Total Defect Qty, Total Downtime Minutes by Material Type** tile.

   ![Total Defect Qty, Total Downtime Minutes by Material Type tile](media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier10.png)

   Raw materials appear to be well managed; although they have more defects, they have lower total downtime minutes.

### Compare defects to downtime by year
1. Select the **Total Defect Reports by Plant, Defect Type** map tile to open the report to the **Supplier Quality Analysis** page.
2. In the **Total Defect Qty by Month and Year** chart, notice that defect quantity is higher in 2014 than in 2013.  

    ![Total Defect Qty by Month and Year chart](media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier11.png)  
3. Do more defects translate into more downtime? Ask questions in the Q&A box to find out.  
4. Select **Supplier Quality Analysis Sample** in the top nav pane to return to the dashboard.  
5. Because we know that raw materials have the highest number of defects, type in the question box: *show material types, year, and total defect qty*.  

    There were many more raw materials defects in 2014 than in 2013.  

    ![Q&A question: Show material types, year, and total defect qty](media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier12.png)  
6. Next, change the question to: _show material types, year, and total **downtime minutes**_.  

   ![Q&A question: Show material types, year, and total downtime minutes](media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier13.png)

   Notice that downtime for raw materials was about the same in 2013 and 2014, even though there were many more raw materials defects in 2014. It appears that more defects for raw materials in 2014 didn’t lead to much more downtime for raw materials in 2014.

### Compare defects to downtime month to month
Let’s look at another dashboard tile related to total defective quantity.  

1. Select **Exit Q&A** in the upper-left corner to return to the dashboard.  

    Look more closely at the **Total Defect Quantity by Month, Year** tile. It shows that the first half of 2014 had a similar number of defects as 2013, but in the second half of 2014, the number of defects increased significantly.  

    ![Total Defect Quantity by Month, Year tile](media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier14.png)  

    Let’s see if this increase in defect quantity led to an equal increase in downtime minutes.  
2. In the question box, type *total downtime minutes by month and year as a line chart*.  

   ![Q&A question: Total downtime minutes by month and year as a line chart](media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier15.png)

   Other than a jump in downtime minutes during June and October, the number of defects didn’t result in significantly more downtime. This result shows we’re managing defects well.  
3. To pin this chart to your dashboard, select the pin icon ![Pin icon](media/sample-supplier-quality/pin.png) above the question box.  
4. To explore the outlier months, check out the downtime minutes during October by material type, plant location, category, and so on, by asking questions such as *total downtime minutes in October by plant*. 
5. Select **Exit Q&A** in the upper-left corner to return to the dashboard.

## Next steps: Connect to your data
This environment is a safe one to play in, because you can choose not to save your changes. But if you do save them, you can always select **Get Data** for a new copy of this sample.
