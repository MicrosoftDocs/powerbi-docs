# Close your Power BI account

If you don't want to use Power BI any longer, you can close your Power BI account.  After you close your account, you can't sign in to Power BI. Also, as it states in the data retention policy in the Power BI Terms of Service, Power BI deletes any customer data you uploaded or created. It is not retained.

## Individual Power BI users

If you signed up for Power BI as an individual, you can close your account from the **Settings** screen.

1. In Power BI, select the gear in the upper right, then select **Settings**.

## Managed tenant users

If your organization signed you up for Power BI, contact your tenant admin. Ask them to unassign the license from your account.
