# Closing your Power BI Account

If you don't want to use Power BI any longer, you can close your Power BI account.  After your account is closed, you can no longer sign in to Power BI. Any customer data you uploaded or created in Power BI is deleted, according to the data retention policy in the Power BI Terms of Service.

## Individual Power BI users

If you signed up for Power BI as an individual, you can close your account from the **Settings** screen.

1. In Power BI, select the gear in the upper right, then select **Settings**.
