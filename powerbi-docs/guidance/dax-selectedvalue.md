# DAX: Use SELECTEDVALUE instead of VALUES

As a data modeler, sometimes you might need to write a DAX expression that tests whether a column is filtered by a specific value.

In earlier versions of DAX, this requirement was safely achieved by using a pattern involving three DAX functions. The functions are [IF](/dax/if-function-dax), [HASONEVALUE](/dax/hasonevalue-function-dax) and [VALUES](/dax/values-function-dax). The following measure definition presents an example. It calculates the sales tax amount, but only for sales made to Australian customers.

```dax
Australian Sales Tax =
IF(
    HASONEVALUE(Customer[Country-Region]),
    IF(
        VALUES(Customer[Country-Region]) = "Australia",
        [Sales] * 0.10
    )
)
```

In the example, the HASONEVALUE function returns TRUE only when a single value filters the **Country-Region** column. When it's TRUE, the VALUES function is compared to the literal text "Australia". When the VALUES function returns TRUE, the **Sales** measure is multiplied by 0.10 (representing 10%). If the HASONEVALUE function returns FALSE—because more than one value filters the column—the first IF function returns BLANK.

The use of the HASONEVALUE is a defensive technique. It's required because it's possible that multiple values filter the **Country-Region** column. In this case, the VALUES function returns a table of multiple rows. Comparing a table of multiple rows to a scalar value results in an error.

## Recommendation

We recommend that you use the [SELECTEDVALUE](/dax/selectedvalue-function) function. It achieves the same outcome as the pattern described in this article, yet more efficiently and elegantly.

Using the SELECTEDVALUE function, the example measure definition is now rewritten.

```dax
Australian Sales Tax =
IF(
    SELECTEDVALUE(Customer[Country-Region]) = "Australia",
    [Sales] * 0.10
)
```

> [!TIP]
> It's possible to pass an _alternate result_ value into the SELECTEDVALUE function. The alternate result value is returned when either no filters—or multiple filters—are applied to the column.
