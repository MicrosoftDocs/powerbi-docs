# Unlock insights with a Power BI CoE

This article targets IT professionals and IT managers. It commences discussion on how to successfully drive a data culture of business decision making with Power BI.

Effective business decision making involves understanding how and when to:

1. Identify opportunities
1. Manage risk
1. Quantify options
1. Assess potential return on investment (ROI)
1. Act
1. Measure impact
1. ...and then repeat

The challenge for many businesses today, however, is to seize opportunities to make analytics faster, easier, and more insightful. Businesses are realizing that without analytics data is a cost center, not a resource.

It's well understood that business decision making success requires the right data, at the right time, in the right format to become actionable information. In addition, it requires skilled people in many roles enabled with efficient processes, procedures, and appropriate technology. Power BI—as a technology—can deliver all BI needs, empowering people to discover answers and insights hidden in their data.

A Center of Excellence (CoE) is a business function that organizes these people, processes, and technology components into a comprehensive set of business competencies and capabilities. We see a lot of evidence to support that a comprehensive and robust CoE is critical to delivering value and business success. The CoE can include change initiatives, standard processes, roles, guidelines, best practices, support, training, and much more.

## CoE scenarios

We see four common CoE scenarios for BI:

1. [Personal BI](#personal-bi)
1. [Departmental self-service BI](#departmental-self-service-bi-dssbi) (DSSBI)
1. [Traditional corporate centralized BI](#traditional-corporate-centralized-bi-tccbi) (TCCBI)
1. [Modern managed enterprise BI](#modern-managed-enterprise-bi-membi) (MEMBI)

### Personal BI

Personal BI has traditionally been the domain of Excel, which is a versatile tool for storing and presenting data. It's no surprise, however, that business analysts have discovered the usefulness and versatility of [Power BI Desktop](../desktop-what-is-desktop.md). Many have embraced it as their tool of choice for creating personal BI solutions.

Personal BI solutions commonly represent one-time assessments of a business challenge, like what happens when a business user addresses an ad hoc reporting requirement or a data scientist explores and profiles a new dataset. Their solutions are rarely shared. But, if they are shared, its commonly done informally—perhaps sent by email or saved to a network share.

From a CoE perspective, there's not a lot to say about Personal BI, except to state that sharing should adhere to IT policy. Such policy should strive to protect all corporate data assets, which includes personal BI solutions (data files, workbooks, Power BI Desktop files). The personal BI scenario, therefore, is not directly covered in this series of articles.

### Departmental self-service BI (DSSBI)

Departmental self-service BI can be described as a bottom-up approach to BI. It's what happens when _individuals_ adopt Power BI with success. That success spurs and encourages adoption by others within the team or department, resulting in viral and organic growth. Commonly, department members share in small groups and aren't usually coordinated with other groups. Sometimes, the emergence of DSSBI flourishes without IT awareness, and so use of data sources and sharing of data take place without formal governance.

### Traditional corporate centralized BI (TCCBI)

Traditional corporate centralized BI can be described as a top-down approach to BI. It's also synonymous with the expression "single version of the truth". Commonly, the IT department manage, deliver, and support centralized BI investments. Also known as enterprise BI, IT take responsibility for delivering data warehouse pipelines and platforms designed to deliver the four Cs of data (clean, consistent, credible, current) for business critical functions. Functions can include managing overall results, costs, business goals, customer insights, and many more.

### Modern managed enterprise BI (MEMBI)

Modern managed enterprise BI encourages top-down and bottom-up BI approaches at the same time. We often see this scenario when organizations recognize that data is the lifeblood of modern work. These organizations strive to modernize by using data as an asset.

Not only does this scenario deliver on the strengths of DSSBI and TCCBI, it also optimizes value across departments by driving standardization, knowledge, and reuse of data and BI solutions. More value is derived synergistically when there's the right balance between TCCBI and DSSBI.
