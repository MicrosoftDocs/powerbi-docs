# Power BI implementation planning: Workspaces at the workspace level

This article describes tactical implementation planning that you do at the _workspace level_ for [Microsoft Fabric workspaces](/fabric/fundamentals/workspaces), with an emphasis on the Power BI experience inside Fabric.

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-implementation-planning-context](includes/powerbi-implementation-planning-context.md)]

The article primarily is for:

- **Fabric administrators**: Administrators who are responsible for overseeing the Fabric implementation in the organization.
- **Center of Excellence (CoE), IT, and business intelligence (BI) teams**: Teams that are responsible for overseeing the use of data and BI in the organization, and for supporting self-service users throughout the organization.
- **Content creators and owners**: Self-service users who create, publish, and manage content in workspaces.

To use workspaces effectively, you make many tactical decisions. Whenever possible, individual workspace-level decisions should align with your [tenant-level decisions](powerbi-implementation-planning-workspaces-tenant-level-planning.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The concept of a workspace originated in Power BI. In Fabric, the purpose of a workspace broadens. A Fabric workspace can contain items from more than one [Fabric experience](/fabric/get-started/fabric-terminology) (also called a _workload_). Although the content scope is broader than in Power BI, you can apply most of the workspace planning activities described in these articles to planning your Fabric workspaces.

## Workspace purpose

When you plan a workspace, it's important to consider not only the type of content it will store but also the activities the workspace is intended to support.

Consider the following two examples of finance-related workspaces. Although they're both dedicated to the same team, each workspace serves a different purpose:

- **Financial month-end workspace**: The _Financial month-end workspace_ contains reconciliation and month-end closing reports. This workspace is considered an informal workspace to support collaborative efforts. A Power BI app isn't necessary for content viewers because the primary use of this workspace is collaboration by a small group of people who work closely together. Most team members have permissions that let them edit content in this workspace.
- **Financial reporting workspace**: The _Financial reporting workspace_ contains the finalized, presentation-level reports. This workspace contains content that is broadly distributed throughout the organization to many viewers, including to executives, via a Power BI app. The workspace is closely [governed](powerbi-implementation-planning-workspaces-tenant-level-planning.md#workspace-governance-level).

With these two examples in mind, consider two specific aspects of workspace purpose: _intent for collaboration_ and _intent for viewing_.

### Intent for collaboration

The primary objective of a workspace in the Fabric portal is to facilitate [collaboration](../collaborate-share/service-how-to-collaborate-distribute-dashboards-reports.md#collaborate-in-a-workspace) among multiple contributors.

Collaboration in a workspace occurs in multiple ways:

- **Team-based development**: Users can work together to build, test, and publish content. One user might work on the design of a [lakehouse](/fabric/data-engineering/lakehouse-overview). Another user might work on the design of the semantic model, and other users might focus on building reports.
- **Testing and validations**: Users might need to perform data validations for new content. Subject matter experts from the business unit might need to perform user acceptance testing (UAT). A data quality team might need to validate the accuracy of the semantic model.
- **Enhancements**: Content stakeholders and consumers might suggest enhancements to content throughout the lifecycle of the content.
- **Ownership transfer**: Another person or team might [assume responsibility](fabric-adoption-roadmap-content-ownership-and-management.md#ownership-transfers) for content that someone else created.

One of the key areas of the Fabric adoption roadmap is [content ownership and management](fabric-adoption-roadmap-content-ownership-and-management.md). The type of collaboration that occurs in a workspace differs based on the approach you choose for content ownership and management:

- **Business-led self-service BI**: Content that the content creators in a business unit or department own or manage. In this scenario, most collaboration in the workspace occurs among users in that business unit.
- **Managed self-service BI**: Data that a centralized team owns or manages, but various content creators from business units take responsibility for reports and dashboards. In this scenario, it's highly likely that multiple workspaces are needed to securely facilitate collaboration by multiple teams of people.
- **Enterprise BI**: Content that a centralized team, such as IT, enterprise BI, or the CoE owns or manages. In this scenario, collaboration efforts in the workspace occur among users in the centralized team.

_Checklist_ of key decisions and actions when you plan for collaboration in a workspace:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - **Consider expectations for collaboration**: Determine how workspace collaboration needs to occur and who's involved in a single team or across organizational boundaries.
> - **Consider expectations for content ownership and management**: Think about how the different content ownership and management approaches (business-led self-service BI, managed self-service BI, and enterprise BI) will influence how you design and use workspaces.

> [!TIP]
> When your needs aren't met by taking a single approach, be prepared to be flexible and use a different [content ownership and management](fabric-adoption-roadmap-content-ownership-and-management.md) strategy for different workspaces. The strategy can be based on the scenario and on the team members that are involved.

### Intent for content viewing

The secondary objective for a workspace is to distribute content to consumers who need to view the content. For content viewers, the primary Fabric workload is Power BI.

You can approach content distribution in the Power BI service in multiple ways:

- **Reports can be viewed by using a Power BI app**: Content stored in a nonpersonal workspace can be published to a [Power BI app](../collaborate-share/service-how-to-collaborate-distribute-dashboards-reports.md#distribute-insights-in-an-app). A Power BI app is a more user-friendly experience than viewing reports directly in a workspace. For this reason, using a Power BI app is often the best choice for distributing content to consumers. Audiences for a Power BI app are flexible. However, sometimes your goals for how to distribute content with an app are a factor in determining how to organize content in or across workspaces. For more information about securing Power BI apps, see [Report consumer security planning](powerbi-implementation-planning-security-report-consumer-planning.md#power-bi-app-permissions).
- **Reports can be viewed directly in the workspace**: This approach is often appropriate for informal, collaborative workspaces. [Workspace roles](/fabric/get-started/roles-workspaces#workspace-roles) define who can view or edit the content contained in a workspace. For more information about workspace roles, see [Content creator security planning](powerbi-implementation-planning-security-content-creator-planning.md).
- **Reports can be shared**: Use of [per-item permissions](../collaborate-share/service-share-dashboards.md) (links or direct access) is useful when you need to provide read-only access to a single item in a workspace. We recommend that you use app permissions and workspace roles more frequently than sharing because they're easier to maintain. For more information, see [Report consumer security planning](powerbi-implementation-planning-security-report-consumer-planning.md#per-item-permissions).
- **Reports can be embedded in another application and viewed in the application**: Sometimes the intention is for consumers to view Power BI content embedded in another application. Embedding content is useful when it makes sense for the user to remain in the application to increase efficiency and stay within its workflow.

Another key area of the Fabric adoption roadmap is [content delivery scope](fabric-adoption-roadmap-content-delivery-scope.md). The ways that a workspace support content distribution differs based on the content delivery scope:

- **Personal BI**: Content is intended for the content creator to use. Because sharing content with other users isn't an objective, personal BI is done in a personal workspace as described in the next section.
- **Team BI**: Content is shared with a relatively small number of colleagues who work closely together. In this scenario, most workspaces are informal, collaborative workspaces.
- **Departmental BI**: Content is distributed to many consumers who belong to a large department or business unit. In this scenario, the workspace is primarily for collaboration efforts. In departmental BI scenarios, content is commonly viewed in a Power BI app instead of directly viewed in the workspace.
- **Enterprise BI**: Content is delivered broadly across organizational boundaries to the largest number of target consumers. In this scenario, the workspace is primarily for collaboration efforts. For enterprise BI scenarios, content is commonly viewed in a Power BI app instead of directly viewed in the workspace.

> [!TIP]
> When you plan your workspaces, consider the needs of the audience when determining the workspace [license mode](/fabric/enterprise/licenses). The type of license assigned to the workspace affects the features that are available, including who can view or manage workspace content.

:::image type="icon" source="media/common/checklist.svg" border="false":::

_Checklist_ of key decisions and actions when you consider expectations for how workspace content is viewed:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - **Consider expectations for viewing content**: Determine how you expect consumers to view content that's been published to the workspace. Consider whether viewing will happen directly in the workspace directly or by using a different method.
> - **Determine who the content will be delivered to**: Consider who the target audience is. Also consider the workspace license mode, especially when you expect a significant number of content viewers.
> - **Evaluate needs for a Power BI app**: Consider what the workspace purpose is as it relates to the content distribution requirements. A requirement for a Power BI app can influence decisions about creating a workspace.
> - **Consider expectations for content delivery scope**: Consider how the different content delivery scopes (personal BI, team BI, departmental BI, and enterprise BI) will influence how you design and use workspaces.

> [!TIP]
> Be prepared to be flexible. You can use a different content viewing strategy for workspaces based on the scenario and on the team members that are involved. Also, don't be afraid to use different [content delivery scope](fabric-adoption-roadmap-content-delivery-scope.md) approaches for workspaces when it can be justified.

### Appropriate use of personal workspaces

You can choose from two types of workspaces:

- **Personal workspaces**: Every user has a personal workspace. A personal workspace can be used for publishing certain types of content to the Fabric portal. Its primary purpose is to support [personal BI](powerbi-implementation-planning-usage-scenario-personal-bi.md) usage scenarios.
- **Workspaces**: The primary purpose of a [workspace](../collaborate-share/service-new-workspaces.md) is to support collaboration among multiple users. Secondarily, a workspace can also be used for viewing content.

A personal workspace used for anything other than learning [personal BI](fabric-adoption-roadmap-content-delivery-scope.md#personal), temporary content, or testing increases an organization's risk. In a personal workspace, only the workspace owner creates and manages the content. A personal workspace also doesn't support collaboration with others.

To allow a user to create any type of Fabric item, like a lakehouse or a warehouse, a workspace must be added to a [Fabric capacity](/fabric/enterprise/licenses#capacity). The process applies to both standard workspaces and personal workspaces. You can govern who can create certain types of items in a personal workspace by managing its capacity assignment.

A personal workspace is limited in its options to share content with others. You can't publish a Power BI app from a personal workspace. Also, Power BI apps are an important mechanism for distributing content to the organization. Per-item permissions (links or direct access) are the only way to share personal workspace content with others. Extensive use of per-item permissions involves more effort, and it increases the risk of error. For more information, see [Report consumer security planning](powerbi-implementation-planning-security-report-consumer-planning.md).

:::image type="icon" source="media/common/checklist.svg" border="false":::

_Checklist_ of key decisions and actions when you consider expectations for how personal workspaces are used:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - **Understand the current use of personal workspaces**: Have conversations with your users and review the [activity activity data](../enterprise/service-admin-auditing.md#track-user-activities-in-power-bi) to ensure you understand what users are doing with their personal workspaces.
> - **Decide how personal workspaces should be used**: Decide how personal workspaces should (and should not) be used in your organization. Focus on balancing risk and ease of use with needs for content collaboration and viewing.
> - **Relocate personal workspace content when it's appropriate**: For critical content, move content from personal workspaces to standard workspaces when it's appropriate.
> - **Create and publish documentation about personal workspaces**: Create useful documentation or FAQs for your users about how to effectively use personal workspaces. Make the information available in your centralized portal and in training materials.

For more information, see the Fabric adoption roadmap:

- [Fabric centralized portal](fabric-adoption-roadmap-mentoring-and-user-enablement.md#centralized-portal)
- [Fabric training](fabric-adoption-roadmap-mentoring-and-user-enablement.md#training)
- [Fabric documentation](fabric-adoption-roadmap-mentoring-and-user-enablement.md#documentation)

## Workspace ownership

One of the most important things to consider when you plan workspaces is determining the [ownership and stewardship](fabric-adoption-roadmap-content-ownership-and-management.md#ownership-and-stewardship) roles and responsibilities. The goal is to have clarity on exactly who is accountable for creating, maintaining, publishing, securing, and supporting the content in each workspace.

Clarity on ownership is especially relevant when responsibilities for creating and managing data are decentralized or distributed among departments and business units. This concept is also sometimes referred to as a _data mesh_ architecture. For more information about data mesh, see [What is data mesh?](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/cloud-scale-analytics/architectures/what-is-data-mesh).

In Fabric, decentralized or distributed ownership is enabled through workspaces. Different areas of the organization can work independently but still contribute to the same underlying data structure in [OneLake](/fabric/onelake/onelake-overview). Each workspace can have its own administrator, access control, and capacity assignment (for billing, geographic data location, and performance monitoring).

> [!TIP]
> Another way to support workspace ownership in Fabric is with [domains](#workspace-domain), which are described later in this article.

When the intent for collaboration involves decentralization and multiple teams beyond a single business unit, it can add complexity for managing workspaces. Often, it's helpful to [create separate workspaces](/fabric/cicd/best-practices-cicd#separate-development-between-teams) to clearly delineate which team is responsible for which content. Use of multiple workspaces allows you to be specific as to ownership and management responsibilities, and it can help you to set security according to the [principle of least privilege](/azure/active-directory/develop/secure-least-privileged-access). For more security considerations, see [Content creator security planning](powerbi-implementation-planning-security-content-creator-planning.md).

> [!TIP]
> Your decisions related to accountability and responsibility should correlate directly with your actions related to defining [workspace access](#workspace-access), which is described later in this article.

:::image type="icon" source="media/common/checklist.svg" border="false":::

_Checklist_ of key decisions and actions when you consider workspace ownership responsibilities:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - **Gain a full understanding of how content ownership works**: Ensure that you wholly understand how content ownership and management happens throughout the organization. Recognize that you likely won't have a one-size-fits-all approach to apply uniformly across the entire organization. Understand decentralized or distributed ownership needs.
> - **Define and document roles and responsibilities**: Ensure that you define and document clear roles and responsibilities for people who collaborate in workspaces. Make this information available in onboarding activities, in training materials, and in your centralized portal.
> - **Create a responsibility matrix**: Map out who is expected to handle each function to create, maintain, publish, secur, and support content. Have this information ready when you start planning for workspace access roles.
> - **Consider co-ownership or multi-team ownership scenarios**: Identify a scenario when it would be helpful to create separate workspaces so that responsibilities are clear.
> - **Create workspace management documentation**: Educate workspace administrators and members about how to manage workspace settings and access. Include responsibilities for workspace administrators, members, and contributors. Make the information available in your centralized portal and in training materials.

## Workspace organization

How to organize workspaces is one of the most important aspects of workspace planning.

Different business units and departments might use workspaces differently depending on their collaboration requirements. When you need a new workspace, we recommend that you consider the factors described in this section.

### Workspace subject and scope

The following options present some suggestions about how you can organize workspaces by subject and scope.

In some cases, you might already have some useful groups established in Microsoft Entra ID. You can use the groups to manage access to resources for the defined subject area and scope. However, you might need to create new groups to fully implement this approach. For more information, see [Workspace access](#workspace-access).

#### Option 1: One workspace per subject area or project

If you create one workspace for each subject area or project, you can focus on the workspace purpose. This approach can be more balanced in the distribution of content among workspaces.

Examples: _Quarterly Financials_ or _Product Launch Analysis_

The advantages of option 1 include:

- It's more straightforward to manage user access for who can edit or view content because access is scoped per subject area.
- When users across organizational boundaries access content, structuring workspaces by subject area is more flexible and easier to manage, which is compared to option 2, discussed next.
- One scope per subject area is a good compromise between workspaces that contain too many items and workspaces that contain too few items.

A disadvantage of option 1 is that, depending on how narrow or wide workspaces are defined, you still risk users creating an excessive number of workspaces. Finding content can be challenging for users when content is spread across many workspaces.

> [!TIP]
> When they're well-planned and managed, creating one workspace per subject area or project usually results in a manageable number of workspaces.

#### Option 2: One workspace per department or team

A common approach is to create one workspace per department, team, or business unit. In fact, alignment with the organizational chart is the most common way people begin planning workspaces. But this approach isn't ideal for all scenarios.

Examples: _Finance Department_ or _Sales Team Analytics_

The following diagram depicts a generalized example of how you might separate workspaces by department, team, or subject area. Option 1 and option 2 look the same. The items to include in each workspace depends on the nature of the data each department, team, or subject area focuses on, and how they intend to use the data.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi-implementation-planning-workspace-planning/workspace-planning-area.svg" alt-text="Diagram that shows separate workspaces for departments, teams, or subject areas." border="false":::

The advantages of option 2 include:

- Getting started with planning is simple. All content that department users need is in one workspace.
- It's easy for users to know which workspace to use because all their content is published in the workspace associated with their department or team.
- Managing security roles can be straightforward, especially when you use the best practice of assigning Microsoft Entra groups to workspace roles.

The disadvantages of option 2 include:

- The result is often a broad-scoped workspace that contains many items. A broadly defined workspace scope can make it challenging for users to locate specific items.
- Because a one-to-one relationship exists between a workspace and a Power BI app, a broadly defined workspace can result in apps for users that contain lots of content. You can mitigate the issue by excluding certain workspace items from the app and via design of app [navigation](../collaborate-share/service-create-distribute-apps.md#set-up-the-app).
- When users from other departments need to view specific workspace items, managing permissions can be more complex. A risk is that people assume that everything in the department workspace is for their eyes only. Another risk is that sharing individual items instead of roles is used to accomplish granular viewing permissions.
- If some content creators need permissions to edit some but not all items, it's not possible to set those permissions in a single workspace. Workspace roles, which determine edit or view permissions, are defined at the workspace level.
- When you have a large number of workspace items, you often need to use strict naming conventions for items so that users can find what they need.
- Broad workspaces with many items might run into a technical [limitation](/fabric/get-started/workspaces#considerations-and-limitations) on the number of items that can be stored in a workspace.

> [!TIP]
> When you create workspaces that align with your organizational chart, you often end up with fewer workspaces. However, you might end up with workspaces that contain disproportionately large amounts of content. We recommend that you don't align workspaces per department or team when you expect to have a significant number of items or many users.

#### Option 3: Workspace for a specific report or app

Creating a workspace for each report or type of analysis isn't recommended except in specific circumstances.

Examples: _Daily Sales Summary_ or _Executive Bonuses_

Advantages of option 3 include:

- The purpose of a narrowly defined workspace is clear.
- Ultra-sensitive content can, and often should, be segregated into its own workspace so that it can be managed and governed explicitly.
- Fine-grained workspace permissions are applicable to a few items. This setup is useful when, for example, a user is permitted to edit one report but not another.

Disadvantages of option 3 include:

- If overused, narrowly defined workspaces can lead to a large number of workspaces.
- A large number of workspaces requires more effort for users. Although users can rely on search, finding the right content in the right workspace can be frustrating.
- A larger number of workspaces increases the auditing and managing workload.

> [!TIP]
> You should create a workspace with a narrow scope, such as an individual report, only for specific reasons. It should be the exception rather than the rule. Occasionally, [separating scorecards](../create-reports/service-goals-create.md) into their own workspace is a useful technique. For example, using a separate workspace is helpful when a scorecard presents goals that span multiple subject areas. It's also helpful to set up specific permissions for managing and viewing the scorecard.

:::image type="icon" source="media/common/checklist.svg" border="false":::

_Checklist_ of key decisions and actions when you consider the subject area and scope of workspace content:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - **Assess how workspaces currently are set up**: Review how people currently use workspaces. Identify what works well and what doesn't work well. Plan for potential changes and user education opportunities.
> - **Consider the best workspace scope**: Identify how you want people to use workspaces based on purpose, subject area, scope, and who's responsible for managing the content.
> - **Identify the location of highly sensitive content**: Determine when you can justify creating a specific workspace to store only highly sensitive content.
> - **Create and publish documentation about using workspaces**: Create useful documentation or FAQs for your users about how they are expected to organize and use workspaces. Make this information available in training materials and in your centralized portal.

### Workspace item types

A common practice to decouple data assets from analytical assets is to separate data workspaces from reporting workspaces.

- A _data workspace_ is dedicated to storing and securing data items such as a lakehouse, warehouse, data pipeline, dataflow, or semantic model.
- A _reporting workspace_ is focused more on downstream analytical activities. A reporting workspace stores and secures only items like reports, dashboards, and metrics. Reporting workspaces typically include Power BI content, but it's not required.

In Fabric, you might extend this separation to have distinct workspaces for other item types.

Some examples include:

- _Data source workspaces_ for data warehouses, lakehouses, and SQL databases that store data
- _Data transformation workspaces_ for data pipelines, notebooks, and dataflows that transform data
- _Distribution workspaces_ for scorecards, metric sets, and organization applications that distribute data to users

The following diagram depicts an example of how you might separate workspaces by item type.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi-implementation-planning-workspace-planning/workspace-planning-item-type.svg" alt-text="Diagram that shows separate workspaces for transformations, data sources, semantic models, and distribution." border="false":::

> [!TIP]
> Each [Fabric experience](/fabric/get-started/fabric-terminology) allows you to create various types of items. These items don't always neatly fit the concept of data versus reporting or analytical content. One example is a [Fabric notebook](/fabric/data-engineering/author-execute-notebook) that can be used in many different ways. Users might use a Fabric notebook to load and transform data in a lakehouse, to submit Spark SQL queries, or to analyze and visualize data by using PySpark. When the workspace contains mixed workloads, we recommend that you focus primarily on the workspace [purpose](powerbi-implementation-planning-workspaces-workspace-level-planning.md#workspace-purpose) and [ownership](powerbi-implementation-planning-workspaces-workspace-level-planning.md#workspace-ownership) of the content as described in this article.

The advantages for separating data workspaces from reporting workspaces include:

- Critical organizational data, such as an [endorsed](../collaborate-share/service-endorse-content.md) lakehouse or semantic model, can reside in a specific workspace designed to make reusable data available at enterprise scale. Common examples include:
  - Report creators can locate and reuse trustworthy [shared semantic models](../connect-data/service-datasets-across-workspaces.md) more easily. For more information, see the [managed self-service BI](powerbi-implementation-planning-usage-scenario-managed-self-service-bi.md) usage scenario.
  - Semantic model creators can locate trustworthy dataflows or lakehouse tables more easily. For more information, see the [self-service data preparation](powerbi-implementation-planning-usage-scenario-self-service-data-preparation.md) usage scenario and the [advanced self-service data preparation](powerbi-implementation-planning-usage-scenario-advanced-data-preparation.md) usage scenario.
- Access management can be centralized for critical organizational data. Managing access separately for the data workspace compared with reporting workspaces is useful when different people are responsible for data and reports. With managed self-service BI, it's common to have many report creators and fewer data creators.
- Limiting who can edit and manage semantic models minimizes the risk of unintentional changes, especially to critical data items that are reused for many purposes or by many users. Physical separation reduces the chances of inadvertent, or unapproved, changes. This extra layer of protection is helpful for [certified](../collaborate-share/service-endorse-content.md#certify-content) semantic models, which the organization relies on for their quality and trustworthiness.
- Co-ownership scenarios are clarified. When shared semantic models are delivered from a centralized BI or IT team, self-service content creators in business units publish reports. A good practice is to segregate the semantic models in a separate workspace. This approach avoids the ambiguity of co-ownership scenarios because ownership and responsibility per workspace is more clearly defined.
- Row-level security (RLS) is enforced. When you encourage creators to work in different workspaces, they don't have unnecessary edit permissions to the original semantic model. The advantage is that [RLS](/fabric/security/service-admin-row-level-security) and [object-level security (OLS)](/analysis-services/tabular-models/object-level-security) are enforced for content creators and content viewers.

Disadvantages for separating data workspaces from reporting workspaces include:

- A workspace naming convention is required to differentiate a data workspace from a reporting workspace.
- Extra user education is required to ensure that content authors and consumers know where to publish and find content.
- Sometimes it's challenging to clearly delineate the item types that should be contained in a workspace. Over time, a workspace can end up containing more types of content than was originally intended.
- Use of separate workspaces results in a larger number of workspaces that you need to manage and audit. As you plan for purpose, scope, and other considerations (such as the separation of development, test, and production content) the approach to workspace design can become more complicated.
- Extra change management processes could be required to track and prioritize requested changes to centralized data items, particularly when report creators have requirements beyond what [composite models](../transform-model/desktop-composite-models.md) and report-level measures can handle.

### Workspace development stage

A common practice is to use separate workspaces for different stages of content development. Typically, this practice involves the following stages:

- _Development workspaces_ for untested changes
- _Test workspaces_ for dedicated internal and user testing
- _Production workspaces_ for releasing content for consumers

In Fabric, you can add workspaces for each stage to a deployment pipeline. A deployment pipeline helps with content lifecycle management, by letting pipeline administrators compare and deploy changes between stages. Typically, you first publish content to the earliest stage (like _development_) and then deploy it to the next stage (like deploying content from _development_ to _test_ workspaces, and then from _test_ to _production_ workspaces).

Here's an example of this setup:

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi-implementation-planning-workspace-planning/workspace-planning-stages-deployment-pipeline.svg" alt-text="Diagram that shows three workspace stages in a deployment pipeline: development, test, and production." border="false":::

You can also combine separating workspaces by both development stage and item type. If you use deployment pipelines, you can use _autobinding_ to ensure that stages are linked. Autobinding ensures that, for example, reports in the _report development workspace_ point to the correct semantic model in the _model development workspace_.

Here's an example:

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi-implementation-planning-workspace-planning/workspace-planning-stages-deployment-pipeline-autobinding.svg" alt-text="Diagram that shows development, test, and production workspaces for reports and models in two separate deployment pipelines linked by autobinding." border="false":::

Optionally, you might have other workspaces, such as the following types of workspaces:

- _Private workspaces_ for creators to work in isolation. Using this setup is a common practice for collaborating on content by using Git integration because each content creator works on their own separate copy (branch) of the content to avoid disrupting each other's work. Then, creators can open a pull request to merge their changes into another branch that syncs to the development workspace, which creators can view, but not modify or publish content to.
- _Preproduction workspaces_ for creators to perform specific tests before releasing content. These tests might include performance testing or testing supporting resources like data gateways and apps.
- _Sandbox workspaces_ for creators to freely experiment and conduct _improvised_ explorations. Sandbox workspaces are typically emptied at a regular cadence (often automatically, such as by using APIs or notebooks). Content that creators want to retain from a sandbox workspace can be copied to a personal or private workspace for more development.

> [!TIP]
> We recommend that you organize workspaces by a minimum of two development stages. Taking this approach ensures separation between development or testing by creators, and consumption by business users. If you use a single workspace stage, you frequently will struggle to avoid disrupting existing content that is consumed from that workspace or from changes from other creators.
>
> Also, you can organize workspaces using multiple approaches. For example, you can use separate data and reporting workspaces that have multiple development stages.

The advantages for separating workspaces by development stage include:

- You can support more sophisticated and structured development processes, including:

  - Deployment Pipelines to copy content between stages
  - Git integration and branching strategies for deployment and release
  - Notebooks to orchestrate or automate certain tasks in the content lifecycle

- You can avoid disrupting production content that consumers use.
- You have better access control for content.

The disadvantages for separating workspaces by development stage include:

- You must manage and govern more workspaces, which create more overhead.
- You must plan for new deployment and post-deployment activities.
- You might have to account for other, non-supported tools or features that deploy or promote content through the development stages.
- More sophisticated workspace access policies are required to prevent creators from publishing to and using the wrong stage.

### Intra-workspace organization

In addition to organizing your workspace structure, you also have to organize content _in_ a single workspace.

To better organize content in a workspace, consider the following guidelines:

- Use clear naming conventions to easily identify different content. Consider using numerical prefixes (like _01 - Daily Sales_ to order content alphabetically, if needed).
- Use _task flows_ to group content by its purpose in your workflow into tasks. Using task flows helps you quickly identify and select similar content (by selecting the task in the task flow). It's important if you decide to include many item types with different purposes in the same workspace.
- Use workspace folders to organize similar content into groups. Workspace folders can be used instead of or in addition to tasks in task flows.
- Use endorsement and sensitivity labels to label content appropriately based on their endorsement and sensitivity status.

## Workspace access

Because the primary purpose of a workspace is collaboration, workspace access applies primarily to users who create and manage workspace content. Access can also be relevant when the workspace is used for viewing content. This purpose is a secondary purpose for workspaces, as described earlier in the article.

When you begin to plan for [workspace roles](/fabric/get-started/roles-workspaces#workspace-roles), it's helpful to consider the following questions:

- How does collaboration occur in the workspace?
- Will consumers directly view content in the workspace?
- Who is responsible for managing the content in the workspace?
- Who can view content stored in the workspace?
- Do you intend to assign individual users or groups to workspace roles?

A best practice is to use groups to assign workspace roles. Security groups, mail-enabled security groups, distribution groups, and Microsoft 365 groups are all supported for workspace roles. For more information about using groups, see [Tenant-level security planning](powerbi-implementation-planning-security-tenant-level-planning.md#strategy-for-using-groups).

When you plan to use groups, you might consider creating one group per role per workspace. For example, to support the _Quarterly Financials_ workspace, you could create the following groups:

- _Fabric workspace **admins** – Quarterly Financials_
- _Fabric workspace **members** – Quarterly Financials_
- _Fabric workspace **contributors** – Quarterly Financials_
- _Fabric workspace **viewers** – Quarterly Financials_
- _Power BI **app viewers** – Quarterly Financials_

> [!TIP]
> You gain flexibility when you create groups per role and per workspace. However, the trade-off is more groups to create and manage. Also, managing a large number of groups can be challenging when only IT creates and maintains groups. You can mitigate the challenge by enabling [self-service group management](/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/groups-self-service-management#self-service-group-management-scenarios) to certain satellite members. These members can include the CoE, champions, or trusted users who are trained in how to manage role memberships for their business units. For more information, see [Tenant-level security planning](powerbi-implementation-planning-security-tenant-level-planning.md#planning-for-power-bi-groups).

When data workspaces are separated from reporting workspaces, as described earlier in this article, it results in an even larger number of groups. Consider how the number of groups doubles from five to 10 when you separate data and reporting workspaces:

- _Fabric **data** workspace **admins** – Quarterly Financials_
- _Fabric **reporting** workspace **admins** – Quarterly Financials_
- _Fabric **data** workspace **members** – Quarterly Financials_
- _Fabric **reporting** workspace **members** – Quarterly Financials_
- _Fabric **data** workspace **contributors** – Quarterly Financials_
- _Fabric **reporting** workspace **contributors** – Quarterly Financials_
- _Fabric **data** workspace **viewers** – Quarterly Financials_
- _Fabric **reporting** workspace **viewers** – Quarterly Financials_
- _Power BI **app viewers** – Quarterly Financials_

When multiple workspaces exist for development, test, and production, it results in an even larger number of groups. Potentially, the number of groups might triple. For example, for just the data workspace admins, you would create these three groups:

- _Fabric data workspace admins – Quarterly Financials **\[Dev\]**_
- _Fabric data workspace admins – Quarterly Financials **\[Test\]**_
- _Fabric data workspace admins – Quarterly Financials_

The preceding examples are intended to convey that the use of groups that map to workspace roles can quickly become unmanageable.

> [!TIP]
> In some scenarios, fewer groups are needed, especially in the area of development. For example, you might not need to specify a workspace viewers group in development. That group is needed only for testing and production. Or you might be able to use the same workspace admins group for development, test, and production. For more information about development, test, and production, see [Workspace lifecycle management](#workspace-lifecycle-management).

The effective use of groups for workspace roles can require considerable planning. Be prepared to encounter scenarios when existing groups (that might be aligned with the organizational chart) don't meet all your needs for managing Fabric content. In this case, we recommend that you create groups specifically for this purpose. The words _Fabric_ or _Power BI_ are included in the group name in the preceding examples for this purpose. If you have multiple business intelligence tools, you can choose to use only _BI_ as the prefix instead. That way, you can use the same groups across multiple tools.

Lastly, the examples show one workspace - _Quarterly Financials_ - but often it's possible to manage a collection of workspaces with one set of groups. For example, multiple workspaces owned and managed by the finance team might be able to use the same groups.

> [!NOTE]
> Often, you plan security more broadly, taking into consideration semantic model [Read](../connect-data/service-datasets-manage-access-permissions.md) and [Build](../connect-data/service-datasets-build-permissions.md) permissions and [row-level security (RLS)](/fabric/security/service-admin-row-level-security) requirements. For more information about what to consider to support report consumers and content creators, see the [security implementation planning](powerbi-implementation-planning-security-overview.md) articles. This article focuses only on workspace roles as part of the workspace planning process.

_Checklist_ of key decisions and actions when you consider workspace access:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - **Refer to roles and responsibilities**: Use the roles and responsibilities information prepared earlier to plan for workspace roles.
> - **Identify who'll own and manage the content**: Verify that all the items you expect to store in a single workspace align with the people who are responsible for owning and managing the content. If mismatches occur, consider how the workspaces could be better organized.
> - **Identify who'll view content in the workspace**: Determine whether people will view content directly from the workspace.
> - **Plan for the workspace roles**: Determine which people are suited to the Admin, Member, Contributor, and Viewer roles for each workspace.
> - **Decide on group or individual role assignments**: Determine whether you intend to assign individual users or groups to workspace roles. Check whether you can use existing groups for workspace role assignments.
> - **Determine whether new groups need to be created**: Consider carefully whether you need to create a new group per workspace role. Bear in mind that it can result in creating and maintaining many groups. Determine what the process is when a new workspace is created and how related groups will be created.
> - **Configure and test the workspace role assignments**: Verify that users have the appropriate security settings they need to be productive when they create, edit, and view content.

## Workspace domain

As described earlier in this article, it's critical to have clarity on workspace ownership. One way to further support workspace ownership in Fabric is by using domains. A _domain_ is a logical grouping of multiple workspaces that have similar characteristics.

For more information about planning for domains in your tenant, see [Workspace domains](powerbi-implementation-planning-workspaces-tenant-level-planning.md#workspace-domains).

## Workspace settings

You can set up several settings for each individual workspace. These settings can significantly influence how collaboration occurs, who is allowed to access the workspace, and the level of data reusability across Fabric workloads.

### Workspace license mode

Each workspace has a [license mode](/fabric/get-started/workspaces#license-mode) setting. You can set a workspace license mode to **Pro**, **Premium per user**, **Premium capacity**, **Embedded**, **Fabric capacity**, or **Trial**.

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-premium-notification](includes/powerbi-premium-notification.md)]

The [type of license](/fabric/enterprise/licenses#microsoft-fabric-license-types) is important for workspace planning because it determines:

- **Features**: Different features are supported. PPU includes more features (such as [deployment pipelines](/fabric/cicd/deployment-pipelines/intro-to-deployment-pipelines)) that aren't available in Pro. Many more Fabric features (such as [lakehouses](/fabric/data-engineering/lakehouse-overview)) become available for workspaces assigned to a Fabric capacity.
- **Content access**: The license type determines who can access content in the workspace:

  - Only users who have a PPU license (in addition to being assigned a workspace role) can access a PPU workspace.
  - If you expect to deliver content to content viewers who have a free license, you need a [license of F64 or higher](/fabric/enterprise/licenses#capacity-and-skus).

- **Data storage location**: When you need to store data in a specific geographic region (outside of your home region), that becomes possible with a workspace assigned to a capacity (and, accordingly, the capacity is created in that region). For more information about data storage location, see [Tenant setup](powerbi-implementation-planning-workspaces-tenant-level-planning.md).

:::image type="icon" source="media/common/checklist.svg" border="false":::

_Checklist_ of key decisions and actions when you consider workspace license mode:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - **Consider which features are required for each workspace**: Determine the feature requirements of each workspace. Consider differences in workload and which users you intend to access the workspace.
> - **Set the workspace license mode**: Review and update each workspace license mode according to which features are needed by each workspace.

### Workspace lifecycle management

When content creators collaborate to deliver analytical solutions that are important to the organization, you must make various _lifecycle management_ decisions. The lifecycle management processes are also called _continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD)_, and they're one aspect of DevOps.

[Lifecycle management](/fabric/cicd/cicd-overview) considerations include how to:

- Ensure timely, reliable, and consistent delivery of content.
- Communicate and coordinate activities between multiple content creators who are working on the same project.
- Resolve conflicts when multiple content creators edit the same item in the same project.
- Structure a straightforward and reliable deployment process.
- Roll back deployed content to a previous stable, working version.
- Balance fast releases of new features and bug fixes as you safeguard production content.

Fabric has two main lifecycle management components:

- **Version control of content**: [Git integration](/fabric/cicd/git-integration/intro-to-git-integration) allows content owners and creators to create versions of their work. It can be used with [web-based development in a workspace](/fabric/cicd/git-integration/manage-branches#develop-using-another-workspace), or when teams develop in a [client tool](/fabric/cicd/git-integration/manage-branches#develop-using-client-tools), such as Power BI Desktop. Version control (also called _source control_) is achieved by tracking all revisions to a project by using _branches_ associated with local and remote _repositories_ in [Azure DevOps](/fabric/cicd/git-integration/git-get-started?tabs=commit-to-git&preserve-view=true). Changes are _[committed](/fabric/cicd/git-integration/git-get-started?tabs=commit-to-git&preserve-view=true)_ at regular intervals to branches in the remote repository. When a content creator completes revisions that are tested and approved, their branch is _merged_ with the latest version of the solution in the main remote repository (after they resolve any merge [conflicts](/fabric/cicd/git-integration/conflict-resolution)). Git integration can be specified for each workspace in the Fabric portal if the feature is enabled in the [tenant settings](/fabric/admin/git-integration-admin-settings).
- **Promoting content**: [Deployment pipelines](/fabric/cicd/deployment-pipelines/intro-to-deployment-pipelines) are primarily focused on release management in order to maintain a stable environment for users. You can assign a workspace to a stage (development, test, or production) in a deployment pipeline. Then, you can easily and systematically _promote_, or _deploy_, your content to the next stage.

When you combine the lifecycle management features, during your planning process, cosider using [best practices](/fabric/cicd/best-practices-cicd). For example, you might choose to use Git integration for your development workspace and deployment pipelines to publish to your test and production workspaces. Those types of decisions require using the agreed-upon practice consistently. We recommend that you do a proof of concept to fully test your setup, processes, and [permissions model](/fabric/cicd/best-practices-cicd#plan-your-permission-model).

:::image type="icon" source="media/common/checklist.svg" border="false":::

_Checklist_ of key decisions and actions when you plan for lifecycle management of your workspaces:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - **Determine how users need to use version control**: Analyze how your self-service and advanced content creators work to determine whether file versioning with OneDrive for Business or SharePoint is appropriate. Introduce Git integration for advanced users who need more capabilities. Prepare to support both types of users.
> - **Determine how users need to promote content**: Analyze how your self-service and advanced content creators work to determine whether deployment pipelines are a good fit for promoting content.
> - **Decide whether Git integration should be enabled**: Consider whether Git integration with workspaces is a good fit for how your content creators work. Set the _Users can synchronize workspace items with their Git repositories_ tenant setting to align with this decision. Review each of the Git integration tenant settings and set them according to your governance guidelines.
> - **Do a proof of concept**: Conduct a technical proof of concept to clarify how you intend for Git workspaces and deployment pipelines to work together.
> - **Decide which workspaces should have Git integration**: Consider how your content creators work, and which workspaces should be assigned to a development, test, or production (release) branch.
> - **Verify licenses**: Confirm that you have a capacity license available to use Git integration. Ensure that each workspace is assigned to a Fabric capacity or Power BI Premium capacity.
> - **Set up Azure DevOps**: Work with your administrator to set up the Azure DevOps projects, repositories, and branches that you need for each workspace. Assign appropriate access to each repository.
> - **Connect workspaces**: Connect each workspace to the appropriate Azure DevOps repository.
> - **Consider who should deploy to production**: Make decisions about who can update production content and how. Ensure that these decisions align with how workspace ownership is handled in your organization.
> - **Educate content creators**: Ensure that all your content creators understand when to use lifecycle management features and practices. Educate them on the workflow and how different workspaces impact lifecycle management processes.

### Workspace integration with Data Lake Storage Gen2

It's possible to connect a workspace to an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account. You might take this approach for two reasons:

- **Storage of Power BI dataflows data**: If you choose to bring-your-own-data-lake, the data for Power BI dataflows (Gen1) could be accessed directly in Azure. Direct access to [dataflow storage in Data Lake Storage Gen2](../transform-model/dataflows/dataflows-azure-data-lake-storage-integration.md) is helpful when you want other users or processes to view or access the data. It's especially helpful when your goal is to reuse dataflows data beyond Power BI. You have two choices for assigning storage:

  - [Tenant-level storage](powerbi-implementation-planning-usage-scenario-self-service-data-preparation.md#tenant-level-storage), which is helpful when you want to centralize all data for Power BI dataflows into one Data Lake Storage Gen2 account.
  - [Workspace-level storage](powerbi-implementation-planning-usage-scenario-self-service-data-preparation.md#workspace-level-storage), which is helpful when business units manage their own data lake or have certain data residency requirements.

- **Backup and restore for Power BI semantic models**: The [Power BI semantic model backup and restore feature](../enterprise/service-premium-backup-restore-dataset.md) is supported for workspaces that are assigned to capacity or PPU. This feature uses the same Data Lake Storage Gen2 account that's used for storing Power BI dataflows data (described in the previous bullet point). Semantic model backups are helpful for:

  - Complying with data retention requirements
  - Storing routine backups as part of a disaster recovery strategy
  - Storing backups in another region
  - Migrating a data model

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Setting [Azure connections](/fabric/admin/service-admin-portal-azure-connections) in the Fabric admin portal doesn't mean that all dataflows for the entire tenant are stored by default to a Data Lake Storage Gen2 account. To use an explicit storage account (instead of internal storage), each workspace must be explicitly connected. It's critical that you set the workspace Azure connections _before you create any Power BI dataflows_ in the workspace.

:::image type="icon" source="media/common/checklist.svg" border="false":::

_Checklist_ of key decisions and actions when you plan for workspace integration with Data Lake Storage Gen2:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - **Decide whether the workspace will be used in ways that require Azure Storage**: Consider whether a bring-your-own-data-lake scenario would be useful for the storage of dataflows and whether you have requirements to use the semantic model backup and restore functionality.
> - **Determine which Azure Storage account to use**: Select an Azure Storage account that has the [hierarchical namespace](/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-namespace) enabled (Data Lake Storage Gen2) for tenant-level (centralized) storage of dataflows data or semantic model backups. Ensure you have the Azure Storage account information readily available.
> - **Configure the tenant-level storage account**: In the Fabric admin portal, set the tenant-level Data Lake Storage Gen2 storage account.
> - **Decide whether workspace administrators can connect a storage account**: Have discussions to understand the needs of decentralized teams, and whether individual teams are currently maintaining their own Azure Storage accounts. Decide whether this capability should be enabled.
> - **Configure the admin setting for workspace-level storage**: In the Fabric admin portal, enable the option that allows workspace administrators to connect their own storage account.
> - **Set the workspace-level Azure Storage connections**: Specify the Azure Storage account for each individual workspace. You must set the storage account prior to creating any Power BI dataflows in the workspace. If you intend to use semantic model backups, ensure the workspace license mode is set to capacity or PPU.
> - **Update your workspace management documentation**: Ensure that your workspace management documentation includes information about how to assign Data Lake Storage Gen2 storage accounts correctly. Make the information available in your centralized portal and in training materials.

### Workspace integration with Log Analytics

[Log Analytics](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview) is a service of [Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/#features). You can use Log Analytics to review diagnostic data generated by the Analysis Services engine, which hosts Power BI semantic models. Workspace-level logs are useful for analyzing performance and trends, performing data refresh analysis, analyzing XMLA endpoint operations, and more. Log Analytics is available only for workspaces assigned to capacity or PPU.

> [!NOTE]
> Although the names are similar, the data sent to [Log Analytics](../transform-model/log-analytics/desktop-log-analytics-overview.md) is different from the data captured by the [Power BI activity log](../enterprise/service-admin-auditing.md). The data sent to Log Analytics is concerned with [events](../transform-model/log-analytics/desktop-log-analytics-configure.md#events-and-schema) generated by the Analysis Services engine (for example, _Query begin_ and _Query end_ events). Conversely, the activity log is concerned with tracking [user activities](/fabric/admin/operation-list) (for example, _View report_ or _Edit report_ events).

For more information about semantic model event logs, see [Data-level auditing](powerbi-implementation-planning-auditing-monitoring-data-level-auditing.md).

For more information about how to set up Log Analytics for use with Power BI, see [Configure Log Analytics for Power BI](../transform-model/log-analytics/desktop-log-analytics-configure.md). Be sure to understand prerequisites you must have in place to implement the integration.

:::image type="icon" source="media/common/checklist.svg" border="false":::

_Checklist_ of key decisions and actions when you plan for workspace integration with Log Analytics:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - **Decide whether workspace administrators can connect to Log Analytics**: Determine whether all or some workspace administrators are permitted to use Log Analytics to analyze workspace-level logs. If access is restricted to only certain people, decide which group to use.
> - **Set up the tenant setting for Log Analytics connections**: In the Fabric admin portal, set the tenant setting according to the decision for which workspace administrators set connections.
> - **Set the Log Analytics workspace for each workspace**: In the workspace settings, specify the Log Analytics information for each workspace. To capture workspace-level logs, ensure that the workspace license mode is set to capacity or PPU.
> - **Update your workspace management documentation**: Ensure that your workspace management documentation includes information about how to assign a workspace to Log Analytics.

### Other workspace properties

Several other workspace properties can provide helpful information. For [governed workspaces](powerbi-implementation-planning-workspaces-tenant-level-planning.md#workspace-governance-level), we recommend that you set these properties.

Here are some suggestions for how to set the key settings to improve the experience for your users:

- **Workspace description**: A good workspace description includes a brief but specific explanation of what type of content is in the workspace. You can use up to 4,000 characters to describe:

  - The purpose for the workspace
  - The target audience
  - The type of content published to the workspace
  - Whether the workspace is considered governed
  - Whether the workspace includes development, test, or production data
  - Who to contact for questions or support

- **Workspace contacts**: The workspace contact list includes the workspace administrators by default. If you have technical content owners that are different from the subject matter experts, you might find it helpful to specify other contacts. Other contacts could be groups or individuals who can answer questions about the workspace content.
- **Workspace image**: Consistent use of workspace images can be helpful for users when they scan a list of workspaces.

  Consider using an image to help users identify:

  - The domain or subject area
  - The business unit or team that owns and manages the content
  - A data workspace dedicated to storing reusable items, such as a lakehouse, warehouse, data pipeline, dataflow, or semantic model
  - A reporting workspace dedicated to storing analytical items, such as reports, dashboards, or metrics

- **Data model settings**: Allows workspace members, administrators, and users with Build permissions on the semantic models to edit Power BI data models by using the web interface. This setting is used with the _Users can edit data models in the Power BI service_ tenant setting. This setting should align with your decisions and processes for how to create, manage, and deploy content. Also, consider your method for [version control](#workspace-lifecycle-management) as described earlier.

:::image type="icon" source="media/common/checklist.svg" border="false":::

_Checklist_ of key decisions and actions when you consider other workspace properties:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - **Specify the workspace description**: Ensure to include a helpful and thorough description in the workspace description.
> - **Use a helpful image for the workspace**: Set a consistent image for the workspace that visually helps users understand its subject area, who owns and manages content in the workspace, and the type of content stored in the workspace.
> - **Identify contacts for the workspace**: Verify whether workspace administrators should be the workspace contacts, or whether to set specific users or groups for contact.
> - **Specify data model settings**: Consider which workspaces can permit web-based data model editing. Set the _Users can edit data models in the Power BI service_ tenant setting according to your preferences for who can edit and manage content.

### Other technical factors

Other technical factors might influence your workspace setup:

- Integrating content with other tools and services might have licensing implications. For example, if you embed a [Power Apps visual](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/powerapps-custom-visual) in a Power BI report, you must have relevant Power Apps licenses.
- [Per-workspace storage limits](/fabric/admin/portal-workspaces#workspace-limits) apply to the amount of data you can store in a Pro workspace. If using capacity or PPU isn't an option, consider how to work within the storage limits during the workspace planning process.
- When you install a [template app](../connect-data/service-template-apps-install-distribute.md) from Microsoft AppSource, the app creates a new workspace that has a narrow subject and scope.

:::image type="icon" source="media/common/checklist.svg" border="false":::

_Checklist_ of key decisions and actions when you consider other technical factors:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - **Pay attention to technical factors**: As you work through the planning process, determine whether a technical consideration or limitation (such as per-workspace storage limits) influences your decision-making process.
> - **Reorganize workspace content**: If storage limits might become a problem, create separate workspaces now, and then republish content to these new workspaces.
