## Power BI adoption framework

The [Power BI adoption framework](https://github.com/pbiaf/powerbiadoption) describes additional aspects of _how_ to adopt Power BI in more detail. The original intent of the framework was to support Microsoft partners with a lightweight set of resources for use when helping their customers deploy and adopt Power BI.

The framework can augment this Power BI adoption roadmap series. The roadmap series focuses on the _why_ and _what_ of adopting Power BI, more so than the _how_.

## Enterprise deployment whitepaper

The [Planning a Power BI enterprise deployment](https://aka.ms/PBIEnterpriseDeploymentWP) whitepaper provides a comprehensive overview for Power BI implementers. Its primary goal is awareness of options, key considerations, decisions, and best practices. Because of the breadth of content, different sections of the whitepaper will appeal to managers, IT professionals, and self-service authors. The whitepaper is updated every 12-24 months.

The whitepaper goes deeper into the _what_ and _how_ of adopting Power BI, with a strong focus on technology. When you've finished reading the series of Power BI adoption articles, the whitepaper will fill you in with extra information to help put your plans into action.

## Microsoft's BI transformation

Consider reading about [Microsoft's journey and experience with driving a data culture](center-of-excellence-microsoft-business-intelligence-transformation.md). This article describes the importance of two terms: _discipline at the core_ and _flexibility at the edge_. It also shares Microsoft's views and experience about the importance of establishing a COE.

## Power Platform adoption

The Power Platform team has an excellent set of adoption-related content. Its primary focus is on Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power Virtual Agents. Many of the ideas presented in this content can be applied to Power BI also.

The [Power CAT Adoption Maturity Model](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/power-cat-adoption-maturity-model-repeatable-patterns-for-successful-power-platform-adoption/), published by the Power CAT team, describes repeatable patterns for successful Power Platform adoption.

The [Power Platform Center of Excellence Starter Kit](/power-platform/guidance/coe/starter-kit) is a collection of components and tools to help you develop a strategy for adopting and supporting Microsoft Power Platform.

The [Power Platform adoption best practices](/power-platform/guidance/adoption/methodology) includes a helpful set of documentation and best practices to help you align business and technical strategies.

The [Power Platform adoption framework](https://github.com/PowerPlatformAF/PowerPlatformAF/wiki) is a community-driven project with excellent resources on adoption of Power Platform services at scale.

## Microsoft 365 and Azure adoption

You may also find useful adoption-related guidance published by other Microsoft technology teams.

- The [Maturity Model for Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/community/microsoft365-maturity-model--intro) provides information and resources to use capabilities more fully and efficiently.
- Microsoft Learn has a series of modules to [use the Microsoft service adoption framework to drive adoption in your enterprise](/learn/paths/m365-service-adoption/).

## Industry guidance

The [Data Management Maturity (DMM) model](https://cmmiinstitute.com/data-management-maturity) is a paid resource from ISACA. It's a comprehensive framework of data management practices in six key categories. It's designed to helps organizations benchmark their capabilities, identify strengths and gaps, and leverage their data assets to improve business performance.

The [Data Management Book of Knowledge](https://www.dama.org/cpages/body-of-knowledge) (DMBOK2) is a book available for purchase from DAMA International. It contains a wealth of information about maturing your data management practices.

These resources aren't required to take advantage of the guidance provided in this Power BI adoption series. They're reputable resources should you wish to continue your journey.
