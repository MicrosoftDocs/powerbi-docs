# Power BI implementation planning: Security

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-implementation-planning-context](includes/powerbi-implementation-planning-context.md)]

This article introduces a series of articles about Power BI security. The series of articles is targeted at:

- **Power BI administrators:** The administrators who are responsible for overseeing Power BI in the organization.
- **Center of Excellence, IT, and BI team:** The teams that are also responsible for overseeing Power BI. They also support self-service users throughout the organization.
- **Content creators:** Self-service BI creators who set up permissions for the content they create and publish.

The series of articles is intended to expand upon the content in the [Power BI security white paper](whitepaper-powerbi-security.md). While the Power BI security white paper focuses on key technical topics such as authentication, data residency, and network isolation, the primary goal of the series is to provide you with considerations and decisions to help you plan for security and privacy.

It's important to plan to address challenges related to security, which include:

- Identifying and appropriately managing the volume and variety of data that's stored in many locations.
- Ensuring that sensitive data is appropriately stored and shared.
- Keeping pace with the regulatory landscape, which is ever-changing.
- Educating Power BI content creators on appropriate practices in relation to security and privacy.

> [!TIP]
> Also see the [information protection and data loss prevention](powerbi-implementation-planning-info-protection-data-loss-prevention-overview.md) articles. They contain information that's complementary to this series of articles.
