# DAX: DIVIDE function vs divide operator (/)

This article targets data modelers who define DAX expressions.

## Background

When writing a DAX expression to divide a numerator by a denominator, you can choose to use the [DIVIDE](/dax/divide-function-dax) function or the divide operator (/ - forward slash).

When using the DIVIDE function, you must pass in numerator and denominator expressions. Optionally, you can pass in a value that represents an alternate result.

```dax

DIVIDE(<numerator>, <denominator> [,<alternateresult>])

```

The DIVIDE function has been designed to automatically handle division by zero cases. If an alternate result is not passed in, and the denominator is zero or BLANK, the function returns BLANK. If an alternate result is passed in, it's returned instead of BLANK.

The DIVIDE function is convenient because it saves your expression from having to first test the denominator value. The function is also better optimized for testing the denominator value than the [IF](/dax/if-function-dax) function. The performance gain is significant since checking for division by zero is expensive. Using DIVIDE also results in a more concise and elegant expression.

## Example

The following measure expression produces a safe division, but it involves using four DAX functions.

```dax

=IF(OR(ISBLANK([Sales]), [Sales] == 0), BLANK(), [Profit] / [Sales])

```

This measure expression achieves the same outcome, yet more efficiently and elegantly.

```dax

=DIVIDE([Profit], [Sales])

```

## Recommendations

We recommend that you use the DIVIDE function whenever the denominator is an expression that _could_ return zero or BLANK.

In the case that the denominator is a constant value, we recommend that you use the divide operator. In this case, the division is guaranteed to succeed, and your expression will perform better because it will avoid unnecessary testing.

You should carefully consider whether the DIVIDE function should return an alternate value. For measures, it is usually a better design that they return BLANK. This is because report visuals by default eliminate groupings when summarizations are BLANK. This allows the visual to focus on groups where data exists. When necessary, you can configure the visual to display all groups (that return values or BLANK) within the filter context by enabling the "Show Items With No Data" option.
