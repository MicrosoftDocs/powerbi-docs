> [!NOTE]
> In the objectives and key results (OKRs) framework, _objectives_ are clear, high-level descriptions of what you want to achieve. In contrast, _key results_ are specific, achievable outcomes to measure progress toward one of your objectives.
>
> Further, _initiatives_ or _solutions_ are processes or tools built to help you achieve one or more key results. Solutions address specific data needs for users. A solution can take many forms, such as a data pipeline, a data lakehouse, or a Power BI semantic model or report.
