# DAX sample model

The **Adventure Works DW 2020** Power BI Desktop sample model is designed to support your DAX learning. The model is based on the [Adventure Works data warehouse sample](/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure#data-warehouse-downloads) for AdventureWorksDW2017â€”however, the data has been modified to suit the objectives of the sample model.

## Scenario

The Adventure Works company represents a bicycle manufacturer that sells bicycles and accessories to global markets. The company has their data warehouse data stored in an Azure SQL Database.
