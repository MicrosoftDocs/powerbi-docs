# Power BI implementation planning: Workspaces

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-implementation-planning-context](includes/powerbi-implementation-planning-context.md)]

This overview introduces a series of articles that describe implementation planning for [Microsoft Fabric workspaces](/fabric/fundamentals/workspaces). The articles focus on the Power BI experience inside Fabric.

The articles in the series are written for multiple audiences:

- **Fabric administrators**: Administrators who are responsible for overseeing the Fabric implementation in the organization.
- **Center of Excellence (CoE), IT, and business intelligence (BI) teams**: Teams that are responsible for overseeing the use of data and BI in the organization, and for supporting self-service users throughout the organization.
- **Content creators and owners**: Self-service users who create, publish, and manage content in workspaces.

Comprehensive workspace planning is an integral part of a successful implementation. Gaps in workspace planning can reduce user flexibility and lead to inferior workarounds in organizing and securing content.

A workspace is a container in the Fabric portal where users store and secure content. Workspaces are primarily designed for content creation and collaboration.

> [!NOTE]
> The concept of a workspace originated in Power BI. In Fabric, the purpose of a workspace broadens. A Fabric workspace can contain items from more than one [Fabric experience](/fabric/get-started/fabric-terminology) (also called a _workload_). Although the scope of content in a Fabric workspace is broader than in Power BI, you can apply most of the implementation planning in these articles to planning your Fabric workspaces.

## Articles

The workspace planning content is organized in the following articles:

- **[Tenant-level workspace planning](powerbi-implementation-planning-workspaces-tenant-level-planning.md)**: This article describes strategic decisions and actions you take that affect all workspaces in the tenant.

   _Strategic planning_ covers goals and objectives for your organization's implementation.
- **[Workspace-level planning](powerbi-implementation-planning-workspaces-workspace-level-planning.md)**: This article describes tactical decisions and actions to take for each workspace.

   _Tactical planning_ describes specific implementation plans that support your long-term implementation strategy.
