# Build permission for shared datasets (preview)

As a creator of *data models* in Power BI Desktop, you can share them as *datasets* in the Power BI service. Then report creators can easily discover and reuse the datasets you've shared. Learn how you control who has access to the data by using the Build permission.

Build permission is only relevant for datasets. When you give users Build permission, they can build new content on a dataset, such as reports, dashboards, pinned tiles from Q&A, and Insights Discovery. They can also build new content on the dataset outside Power BI, such as Excel sheets via Analyze in Excel, XMLA, and export underlying data.

## Ways to give Build permission

You give Build permission for a dataset in a few different ways:

- Members of a workspace with at least a Contributor role automatically have Build permission for datasets in that workspace, and permission to copy a report.
 
- Members of the workspace where the dataset resides can assign the permission to specific users or security groups in the Permission center. If you're a member of the workspace, select **More options** (...) next to a dataset > **Manage Permissions**.

    That opens the Permission center for that dataset, where you can set and change permissions.

- An admin or member of the workspace where the dataset resides can decide during app publishing that users with permission for the app also get Build permission for the underlying datasets. See [Share a dataset](service-datasets-share.md) for details.

- Say you have Reshare and Build permission on a dataset. When you share a report or dashboard built on that dataset, you can specify that the recipients also get Build permission for the underlying dataset.

You can remove a person's Build permission for a dataset. If you do, they can still see the report built on the shared dataset, but they can no longer edit it. See the next section for details.

## Remove Build permission for a dataset

At some point, you may need to remove Build permission for some users of a shared dataset. 

1. In a workspace, go to the **Datasets** list page. 
1. Select **More options** (...) next to the dataset > **Manage permission**.

1. Select **More options** (...) next to a name > **Remove build**.

    They can still see the report built on the shared dataset, but they can no longer edit it.

### Remove Build permission for a dataset in an app

Say you've distributed an app from a workspace to a group of people. Later, you decide to remove access to the app for some people. Removing their access to the app doesn't automatically remove their build and reshare permissions. That's an extra step. 

1. In a workspace list page, select **Update app**. 

    ![Update app](media/service-datasets-build-permissions/power-bi-app-update.png)

1. On the **Permissions** tab, select the **X** to delete the person or group. 

    ![Select the X](media/service-datasets-build-permissions/power-bi-app-delete-user.png)
1. Select **Update app**.

    You see a message explaining that you need to go to **Manage permissions** to remove Build permission for users with existing access. 

    ![Manage permissions message](media/service-datasets-build-permissions/power-bi-dataset-app-remove-message.png)

1. Select **Update**.

1. In the workspace, go to the **Datasets** list page. 
1. Select **More options** (...) next to the dataset > **Manage permission**.

    ![Manage permissions](media/service-datasets-build-permissions/power-bi-dataset-permissions-new-look.png)

1. Select **More options** (...) next to their name > **Remove build**.

    ![Remove Build permission](media/service-datasets-build-permissions/power-bi-dataset-remove-build-permissions.png)

    They can still see the report built on the shared dataset, but they can no longer edit it.

## More granular permissions

Power BI introduced Build permission in June 2019 as a complement to the existing permissions, Read and Reshare. All users who already had Read permission for datasets via app permissions, sharing, or workspace access at that time also got Build permission for those same datasets. They got Build permission automatically because Read permission already granted them the right to build new content on top of the dataset, by using Analyze in Excel or Export.

With this more granular Build permission, you can choose who can only view the content in the existing report or dashboard and who can create content connected to the underlying datasets.

If your dataset is being used by a report outside the dataset workspace, you can't delete that dataset. Instead, you see an error message.

You can remove Build permission. If you do, the people whose permissions you have revoked can still see the report, but can no longer edit the report or export underlying data. Users with only read permission can still export summarized data.
