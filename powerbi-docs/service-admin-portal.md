# Power BI admin portal

The admin portal allows for tenant management of Power BI in your organization. It includes items such as usage metrics, access to the Office 365 admin center, and settings.

Tenant management of Power BI for your company is done through the Power BI admin portal. The admin portal is accessible to all users who are Global Admins in Office 365 or have been assigned the Power BI service administrator role. For more information about the Power BI service administrator role, see [Understanding the Power BI admin role](service-admin-role.md).

All users can see **Admin portal** under the gear icon. If they are not an admin, they can only see the **Premium settings** section, and they can only see the capacities they have rights to manage.

## How to get to the admin portal

Your account needs to be marked as a **Global Admin**, within Office 365 or Azure Active Directory, or have been assigned the Power BI service administrator role, to get access to the Power BI admin portal. For more information about the Power BI service administrator role, see [Understanding the Power BI admin role](service-admin-role.md). To get to the Power BI admin portal, do the following.

1. Select the settings gear in the top right of the Power BI service.
2. Select **Admin Portal**.

![](media/service-admin-portal/powerbi-admin-settings.png)

Within the portal, there are six tabs. These are described below.

* [Usage metrics](#usage-metrics)
* [Users](#users)
* [Audit logs](#audit-logs)
* [Tenant settings](#tenant-settings)
* [Premium settings](#premium-settings)
* [Embed codes](#embed-codes)
* [Organization visuals](#Organization-visuals)

![](media/service-admin-portal/powerbi-admin-landing-page.png)

## Usage metrics
The first tab, in the admin portal, is **Usage metrics**. The usage metrics report gives you the ability to monitor usage within Power BI for your organization. It also provides the ability to see which users, and groups, are the most active within Power BI for your organization.

> [!NOTE]
> The first time you access the dashboard, or after you visit again after a long period of not viewing the dashboard, you'll likely see a loading screen while we load the dashboard.

Once the dashboard loads, you can see two sections of tiles. The first section includes usage data for individual users and the second section has similar information for groups in your organization.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what you can see in each tile:

* Distinct count of all dashboards, reports, and datasets in the user workspace
  
    ![](media/service-admin-portal/powerbi-admin-usage-metrics-number-tiles.png)

* Most consumed dashboard by number of users who can access it. For example, if you have a dashboard that you shared with 3 users, and you also added it to a content pack two different users connected to, its count would be 6 (1 + 3 + 2)
  
    ![](media/service-admin-portal/powerbi-admin-usage-metrics-top-dashboards.png)

* The most popular content users connected to. This would be anything the users could reach through the Get Data process, so SaaS content packs, Organizational content packs, files or databases.
  
    ![](media/service-admin-portal/powerbi-admin-usage-metrics-top-connections.png)

* A view of your top users based on how many dashboards they have, both dashboards they created themselves and dashboards shared to them.
  
    ![](media/service-admin-portal/powerbi-admin-usage-metrics-top-users-dashboards.png)

* A view of your top users based on how many reports they have
  
    ![](media/service-admin-portal/powerbi-admin-usage-metrics-top-users-reports.png)

The second section shows the same type of information, but based on groups. This lets you see which groups in your organization are most active and what kind of information they are using.

With this information, you will be able to get real insights into how people are using Power BI across your organization, and be able to recognize those users, and groups, who are very active in your organization.

## Users

The second tab, in the admin portal, is **Manage Users**. User management, for Power BI, is done in the Office 365 admin center, so this section allows you to quickly reach the area to manage users, admins, and groups within Office 365.

![](media/service-admin-portal/powerbi-admin-manage-users.png)

When you click **Go to O365 Admin Center**, you go directly to the Office 365 admin center landing page, to manage the users of your tenant.

![](media/service-admin-portal/powerbi-admin-o365-admin-center.png)

## Audit logs

The third tab, in the admin portal, is **Audit logs**. The logs are located within the Office 365 Security & Compliance center. This section allows you to quickly access that area within Office 365.

For more information about audit logs, see [Auditing Power BI in your organization](service-admin-auditing.md)

## Tenant settings

The third tab, in the admin portal, is **Tenant settings**. Tenant settings give you more control over what features are made available to your organization. If you have concerns around sensitive data, some of our features may not be right for your organization, or you may only want a given feature to be available to a specific group. If this is the case, you can switch it off in your tenant.

![](media/service-admin-portal/powerbi-admin-tenant-settings.png)

> [!NOTE]
> It can take up to 10 minutes for the setting to take effect for everyone in your tenant.

Settings can have three states:

* **Disabled for the entire organization**: You can disable a feature and make it so users will not be able to use it.

    ![](media/service-admin-portal/powerbi-admin-tenant-settings-disabled.png)

* **Enabled for the entire organization**: You can enable a feature for the entire organization which will let all users have access to that feature.

    ![](media/service-admin-portal/powerbi-admin-tenant-settings-enabled.png)

* **Enabled for a subset of the organization**: You can also enable a feature for a portion of your organization. This can happen in a few different ways. You can enable it for your entire organization except for a specific group of users.

    ![](media/service-admin-portal/powerbi-admin-tenant-settings-enabled-except.png)

    You could also enable the feature only for a specific group of users and also disable it for a group of users. This would make sure that certain users do not have access to the feature even if they are in the allowed group.

    ![](media/service-admin-portal/powerbi-admin-tenant-settings-enabled-except2.png)

The next few sections provide an overview of the different types of tenant settings.

Go here to learn more about [Push apps](service-create-distribute-apps.md).

## Integration settings

### Ask questions about data using Cortana

Users in the organization can ask questions about their data using Cortana.

> [!NOTE]
> This setting applies to the entire organization and cannot be limited to specific groups.

### Use Analyze in Excel with on-premises datasets

Users in the organization can use Excel to view and interact with on-premises Power BI datasets. [Learn more](service-analyze-in-excel.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Disabling **Export Data** also prevents users from using the **Analyze in Excel** feature.

### Use ArcGIS Maps for Power BI

Users in the organization can use the ArcGIS Maps for Power BI visualization provided by Esri. [Learn more](power-bi-visualization-arcgis.md)

### Use global search for Power BI (Preview)

Users in the organization can use external search features that rely on Azure Search. For example, users can use Cortana to retrieve key information directly from Power BI dashboards and reports. [Learn more](service-cortana-intro.md)

## Custom visuals settings

### Enable custom visuals for the entire organization

Users in the organization can interact with and share custom visuals. [Learn more](power-bi-custom-visuals.md)

> [!NOTE]
> This setting applies to the entire organization and cannot be limited to specific groups.

## R visuals settings

### Interact with and share R visuals

Users in the organization can interact with and share visuals created with R scripts. [Learn more](visuals/service-r-visuals.md)

> [!NOTE]
> This setting applies to the entire organization and cannot be limited to specific groups.

## Audit and usage settings

### Create audit logs for internal activity auditing and compliance

Users in the organization can use auditing to monitor actions taken in Power BI by other users in the organization. [Learn more](service-admin-auditing.md)

This setting needs to be enabled for audit log entries to be recorded. There can be up to a 48 hour delay between enabling auditing and being able to view audit data. If you don't see data immediately, check the audit logs later. There can be a similar delay between getting permission to view audit logs and being able to access the logs.

> [!NOTE]
> This setting applies to the entire organization and cannot be limited to specific groups.

### Usage metrics for content creators
Users in the organization can see usage metrics for dashboards and reports they created. [Learn more](service-usage-metrics.md).

You can switch the setting to **Enabled** and then specify who can see usage metrics (entire org or specific security groups).

> [!NOTE]
> Remember that tenant setting changes can take some time to take effect.

### Per-user data in usage metrics for content creators
Usage metrics for content creators will expose display names and email addresses of users who are accessing content. [Learn more](service-usage-metrics.md).

You can switch the setting to **Enabled** and then specify who can see display names and email addresses in the usage metrics (entire org or specific security groups).

Per-user data is enabled for usage metrics by default, and content creator account information is included in the metrics report. If you donâ€™t want to include this information for some or all users, disable the feature for specified security groups or for an entire organization. Account information will then show in the report as *Unnamed*.

> [!NOTE]
> Remember that tenant setting changes can take some time to take effect.


## Dashboard settings

### Data classification for dashboards

Users in the organization can tag dashboards with classifications indicating dashboard security levels. [Learn more](service-data-classification.md)

> [!NOTE]
> This setting applies to the entire organization and cannot be limited to specific groups.

## Developer settings

### Embed content in apps

Users in the organization can embed Power BI dashboards and reports in Software as a Service (SaaS) applications. Disabling this setting prevents users from being able to use the REST APIs to embed Power BI content within their application.

## Capacity Settings

### Premium settings

The Premium settings tab allows you to manage any Power BI Premium (Em or P SKU) capacities that have been purchased for your organization. All users within your organization can see the Premium settings tab, but only see contents within it, if they are assigned as either **Capacity admin** or a user that has assignment permissions. If a user does not have any permissions, the following message appears.

![Power BI Premium admin settings](media/service-admin-portal/premium-settings-no-access.png "No access to Premium settings")

For more information about how to manage Premium settings, see [Manage Power BI Premium](service-admin-premium-manage.md).

### Power BI Embedded settings

The Power BI Embedded settings tab allows you to view your Power BI Embedded (A SKU) capacities that you've purchased for your customer. Since you can only purchase A SKUs from Azure, you can [manage embedded capacities in Azure](developer/azure-pbie-create-capacity.md) from **the Azure Portal**.

![Power BI Embedded admin settings](media/service-admin-portal/manage-pbie-capacities-01.png)

![Power BI Embedded admin settings details](media/service-admin-portal/manage-pbie-capacities-02.png)

For more information about how to manage Power BI Embedded (A SKU) settings, see [What is Power BI Embedded](developer/azure-pbie-what-is-power-bi-embedded.md).

## Embed codes

![Embed codes within the Power BI admin portal](media/service-admin-portal/embed-codes.png)

As an administrator, you can view the embed codes that are generated for your tenant. You have the actions of viewing the report and deleting the embed code to revoke it.

## Organization visuals

The organization visuals tab enables you to deploy and manage custom visuals inside your organization, so you can easily deploy proprietary custom visuals in the organization, for report authors to easily discover and import those visuals directly from Power BI Desktop into their reports.

The page shows all the custom visuals that are currently deployed in the organization repository.

![Org admin visual](media/service-admin-portal/power-bi-custom-visuals-organizational-admin-01.png)

### Add a new custom visual

To add a new custom visual to the list, select **Add a custom visual**

![](media/service-admin-portal/power-bi-custom-visuals-organizational-admin-02.png)

> [!WARNING]
> A custom visual could contain code with security or privacy risks; make sure you trust the author and the source of the custom visual before deploying to the origination repository.

Fill in the fields:

* Choose a .pbiviz file (required): select a custom visual file to upload. Only versioned API custom visuals are supported (read here what this means).

Before you upload a custom visual, you should review that visual for security and privacy to make sure it fits your organization's standards. Read more about custom visuals security.

* Name your custom visuals (required): give a short title to the visual so Power BI Desktop users easily understand what it does

* Icon (required): The icon file that is shown in the Power BI Desktop UI.

* Description: a short description of the visual to provide more context and education to the user

Select "Apply" to initiate the upload request. If successful you can see the new item in the list. If failed, you can get an appropriate error message

### Delete a custom visual from the list

Select the trash bin icon to permanently delete the visual from the repository.
Important: deletion is irreversible. Once deleted, the visual immediately stops rendering in existing reports. Even if you upload the same visual again, it won't replace the previous one that was deleted, users can import the new visual again and replace the instance they have in their reports.

### Disable a custom visual in the list

To disable the visual from the organizational store, select the gear icon. In the **Access** section, disable the custom visual.

After you disable the visual, the visual won't render in existing reports, and it displays the error message below.

*This custom visual is no longer available. Please contact your administrator for details.*

However, visuals that are bookmarked still work.

After any update or administrator change, Power BI Desktop users should restart the application or refresh the browser in the Power BI service to see the updates.

### How to update a visual

If you'd like to update a visual in the repository because there is a new version of the visual (e.g. bug fixes, new functionality, etc.), select the **Update** icon, and upload the new file. Make sure the Visual ID remains unchanged. The new file replaces the previous file for all the reports throughout the organization. However, if the new version of the visual might break any usage or data structure of the previous version of the visual, then do not replace the previous version. Instead, you should create a new listing for the new version of the visual. For example, add a new version number (version X.X) to the title of the new listed visual. This way it is clear that it is the same visual just with an updated version number, so existing reports do not break their functionality. Again, make sure the Visual ID remains unchanged. Then the next time users enter the organization repository from Power BI Desktop, they can import the new version, which prompts them to replace the current version that they have in the report.
