# Power BI admin portal

The admin portal enables you to manage a Power BI *tenant* for your organization. The portal includes items such as usage metrics, access to the Office 365 admin center, and settings.

The full admin portal is accessible to all users who are Global Admins in Office 365 or have been assigned the Power BI service administrator role. If you're not in one of these roles, you only see **Capacity settings** in the portal. For more information about the Power BI service administrator role, see [Understanding the Power BI admin role](service-admin-role.md).

## How to get to the admin portal

Your account needs to be marked as a **Global Admin**, within Office 365 or Azure Active Directory, or have been assigned the Power BI service administrator role, to get access to the Power BI admin portal. For more information about the Power BI service administrator role, see [Understanding the Power BI admin role](service-admin-role.md). To get to the Power BI admin portal, do the following.

1. Select the settings gear in the top right of the Power BI service.

1. Select **Admin portal**.

    ![Settings to admin portal](media/service-admin-portal/powerbi-admin-settings.png)

There are seven tabs in the portal. The rest of this article provides information about each of these tabs.

![Admin portal navigation](media/service-admin-portal/powerbi-admin-landing-page.png)

* [Usage metrics](#usage-metrics)
* [Users](#users)
* [Audit logs](#audit-logs)
* [Tenant settings](#tenant-settings)
* [Premium settings](#premium-settings)
* [Embed codes](#embed-codes)
* [Organization visuals](#organization-visuals)

## Usage metrics

The **Usage metrics** enables you to monitor Power BI usage for your organization. It also provides the ability to see which users, and groups, are the most active within Power BI for your organization.

> [!NOTE]
> The first time you access the dashboard, or after you visit again after a long period of not viewing the dashboard, you'll likely see a loading screen while we load the dashboard.

Once the dashboard loads, you see two sections of tiles. The first section includes usage data for individual users, and the second section has similar information for groups in your organization.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what you can see in each tile:

* Distinct count of all dashboards, reports, and datasets in the user workspace
  
    ![Distinct count of dashboards, reports, datasets](media/service-admin-portal/powerbi-admin-usage-metrics-number-tiles.png)

* Most consumed dashboard by number of users who can access it. For example, if you have a dashboard that you shared with 3 users, and you also added it to a content pack that two different users connected to, its count would be 6 (1 + 3 + 2)
  
    ![Most consumed dashboards](media/service-admin-portal/powerbi-admin-usage-metrics-top-dashboards.png)

* The most popular content users connected to. This would be anything the users could reach through the Get Data process, so SaaS content packs, Organizational content packs, files or databases.
  
    ![Most consumed packages](media/service-admin-portal/powerbi-admin-usage-metrics-top-connections.png)

* A view of your top users based on how many dashboards they have, both dashboards they created themselves and dashboards shared to them.
  
    ![Top users - dashboards](media/service-admin-portal/powerbi-admin-usage-metrics-top-users-dashboards.png)

* A view of your top users based on how many reports they have
  
    ![Top users - reports](media/service-admin-portal/powerbi-admin-usage-metrics-top-users-reports.png)

The second section shows the same type of information, but based on groups. This lets you see which groups in your organization are most active and what kind of content they are consuming.

With this information, you can get real insights into how people are using Power BI across your organization, and be able to recognize those users and groups who are very active in your organization.

## Users

You manage Power BI users, groups, and admins in the Office 365 admin center. The **Users** tab provides a link to the admin center for your tenant.

![Go to O365 Admin Center](media/service-admin-portal/powerbi-admin-manage-users.png)

## Audit logs

You manage Power BI audit logs in the Office 365 Security & Compliance center. The **Audit logs** tab provides a link to the Security & Compliance center for your tenant. [Learn more](service-admin-auditing.md)

To use audit logs, make sure the [**Create audit logs for internal activity auditing and compliance**](#create-audit-logs-for-internal-activity-auditing-and-compliance) setting is enabled.

## Tenant settings

The **Tenant settings** tab enables fine-grained control over the features that are made available to your organization. If you have concerns around sensitive data, some of our features may not be right for your organization, or you may only want a particular feature to be available to a specific group.

The following image shows the first two sections of the **Tenant settings** tab.

![Tenant settings](media/service-admin-portal/powerbi-admin-tenant-settings.png)

> [!NOTE]
> It can take up to 10 minutes for a setting change to take effect for everyone in your tenant.

Settings can have three states:

* **Disabled for the entire organization**: No one in your organization can use this feature.

    ![Disabled all setting](media/service-admin-portal/powerbi-admin-tenant-settings-disabled.png)

* **Enabled for the entire organization**: Everyone in your organization can use this feature.

    ![Enabled all setting](media/service-admin-portal/powerbi-admin-tenant-settings-enabled.png)

* **Enabled for a subset of the organization**: A specific subset of users or groups in your organization can use this feature.

    You can enable the feature for your entire organization, except for a specific group of users.

    ![Enabled subset setting](media/service-admin-portal/powerbi-admin-tenant-settings-enabled-except.png)

    You can also enable the feature only for a specific group of users and also disable it for a group of users. Using this approach ensures that certain users do not have access to the feature even if they are in the allowed group.

    ![Enable except setting](media/service-admin-portal/powerbi-admin-tenant-settings-enabled-except2.png)

The next few sections provide an overview of the different types of tenant settings.

> [!NOTE]
> This setting applies to the entire organization and cannot be limited to specific groups.

## Capacity settings

### Power BI Premium

The **Power BI Premium** tab enables you to manage any Power BI Premium capacities (EM or P SKU) that have been purchased for your organization. All users within your organization can see the **Power BI Premium** tab, but they only see contents within it if they are assigned as either a *Capacity admin* or a user that has assignment permissions. If a user does not have any permissions, the following message appears.

![No access to Premium settings](media/service-admin-portal/premium-settings-no-access.png)

For more information about how to manage Premium settings, see [Manage Power BI Premium](service-admin-premium-manage.md).

### Power BI Embedded

The **Power BI Embedded** tab enables you to view your Power BI Embedded (A SKU) capacities that you've purchased for your customer. Since you can only purchase A SKUs from Azure, you [manage embedded capacities in Azure](developer/azure-pbie-create-capacity.md) from **the Azure Portal**.

For more information about how to manage Power BI Embedded (A SKU) settings, see [What is Power BI Embedded](developer/azure-pbie-what-is-power-bi-embedded.md).

## Embed codes

As an administrator, you can view the embed codes that are generated for your tenant. You can also revoke or delete codes. [Learn more](service-publish-to-web.md)

![Embed codes within the Power BI admin portal](media/service-admin-portal/embed-codes.png)

## Organization visuals

The **Organization visuals** tab enables you to deploy and manage custom visuals inside your organization. With organizational visuals, you can easily deploy proprietary visuals in your organization, which report authors can then discover and import into their reports from Power BI Desktop. [Learn more](power-bi-custom-visuals-organization.md)

> [!WARNING]
> A custom visual could contain code with security or privacy risks; make sure you trust the author and the source of the custom visual before deploying to the organization's repository.

The following image shows all the custom visuals that are currently deployed in an organization's repository.

![Org admin visual](media/service-admin-portal/power-bi-custom-visuals-organizational-admin-01.png)

### Add a new custom visual

To add a new custom visual to the list, follow these steps. 

1. In the right pane, select **Add a custom visual**.

    ![Custom visuals form](media/service-admin-portal/power-bi-custom-visuals-organizational-admin-02.png)

1. Fill in the **Add custom visual** form:

    * **Choose a .pbiviz file** (required): select a custom visual file to upload. Only versioned API custom visuals are supported (read here what this means).

    Before you upload a custom visual, you should review that visual for security and privacy to make sure it fits your organization's standards.

    * **Name your custom visual** (required): give a short title to the visual so Power BI Desktop users easily understand what it does

    * **Icon**: The icon file that is shown in the Power BI Desktop UI.

    * **Description**: a short description of the visual to provide more context and education to the user

1. Select **Add** to initiate the upload request. If successful you can see the new item in the list. If failed, you can get an appropriate error message

### Delete a custom visual from the list

To permanently delete a visual, select the trash bin icon for the visual in the repository.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deletion is irreversible. Once deleted, the visual immediately stops rendering in existing reports. Even if you upload the same visual again, it won't replace the previous one that was deleted. However, users can import the new visual again and replace the instance they have in their reports.

### Disable a custom visual in the list

To disable the visual from the organizational store, select the gear icon. In the **Access** section, disable the custom visual.

After you disable the visual, the visual won't render in existing reports, and it displays the error message below.

*This custom visual is no longer available. Please contact your administrator for details.*

However, visuals that are bookmarked still work.

After any update or administrator change, Power BI Desktop users should restart the application or refresh the browser in the Power BI service to see the updates.

### Update a visual

To update the visual from the organizational store, select the gear icon. Browse and upload a new version of the visual.

Make sure the Visual ID remains unchanged. The new file replaces the previous file for all the reports throughout the organization. However, if the new version of the visual might break any usage or data structure of the previous version of the visual, then do not replace the previous version. Instead, you should create a new listing for the new version of the visual. For example, add a new version number (version X.X) to the title of the new listed visual. This way it is clear that it is the same visual just with an updated version number, so existing reports do not break their functionality. Again, make sure the Visual ID remains unchanged. Then the next time users enter the organization repository from Power BI Desktop, they can import the new version, which prompts them to replace the current version that they have in the report.
