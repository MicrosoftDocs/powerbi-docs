# Create a drill-through button in Power BI (preview)

When you create a button in Power BI, you can select the **Drill through (preview)** action. This action type creates a button that drills through to a focused page to get details that are filtered to a specific context.

A drill-though button can be useful if you want to increase the discoverability of important drill-through scenarios in your reports.

In this example, after the user selects the Word bar in the chart, the **See details** button is enabled.

When they select the **See details** button, they drill through to the Market Basket Analysis page. As you can see from the visual on the left, the drill-through page is now filtered for Word.

## Set up a drill-through button

To set up a drill-through button, you first need to [set up a valid drill-through page](desktop-drillthrough.md) within your report. Then, you need to create a button with **Drill through** as the action type and select the drill-through page as the **Destination**.

Because the drill-through button has two states (when drill through is enabled vs. disabled), you see that there are two tooltip options.

![Set up the drill-through button](media/desktop-drill-through-buttons/power-bi-create-drill-through-button.png)

If you leave the tooltips boxes blank, Power BI automatically generates tooltips. Those tooltips are based on the destination and drill-through field(s).

Here's an example of the autogenerated tooltip when the button is disabled:

"To drill through to Market Basket Analysis (the destination page), select a single data point from Product (the drill-through field)."

![Disabled autogenerated tooltip](media/desktop-drill-through-buttons/power-bi-drill-through-tooltip-disabled.png)

And here's an example of the autogenerated tooltip when the button is enabled:

"Click to drill through to Market Basket Analysis (the destination page)."

However, if you'd like to provide custom tooltips, you can always input a static string. We don't yet support conditional formatting for tooltips.

You can use conditional formatting to change the button text based on the selected value of a field. To do this, you need to create a measure that outputs the desired string based on the DAX function SELECTEDVALUE.

Here's an example measure that outputs "See product details" if a single Product value is NOT selected; otherwise, it outputs "See details for [the selected Product]":

```
String_for_button = If(SELECTEDVALUE('Product'[Product], 0) == 0), "See product details", "See details for " & SELECTEDVALUE('Product'[Product]))
```

Once you've created this measure, you select the **Conditional formatting** option for the button text:

![Select Conditional formatting](media/desktop-drill-through-buttons/power-bi-button-conditional-tooltip.png)

Then, you select the measure you created for the button text:

![Value based on field](media/desktop-drill-through-buttons/power-bi-conditional-measure.png)

When a single product is selected, the button text reads:

"See details for Word"

![When a single value is selected](media/desktop-drill-through-buttons/power-bi-conditional-button-text.png)

When either no products are selected, or more than one product is selected, the button is disabled and the button text reads:

"See product details"

## Pass filter context

The button works like normal drill through, so you can also pass filters on additional fields by cross-filtering the visuals that contain the drill-through field. For example, using **Ctrl** + **click** and cross-filtering, you can pass multiple filters on Store to the drill-through page because your selections cross-filter the visual that contains Product, the drill-through field:

![Passing filter context](media/desktop-drill-through-buttons/power-bi-cross-filter-drill-through-button.png)

When you select the drill-through button, you see filters on both Store and Product being passed through to the destination page:

### Ambiguous filter context

Since the drill-through button isn't tied to a single visual, if your selection is ambiguous, then the button is disabled.

In this example, the button is disabled because two visuals both contain a single selection on Product. There's ambiguity about which data point from which visual to tie the drill-through action to:

## Limitations

- This button doesn't allow for multiple destinations using a single button.
- This button only supports drill throughs within the same report; in other words, it doesn't support cross-report drill through.
- The disabled state formatting for the button is tied to your report theme. Learn more [setting report themes](desktop-report-themes.md#setting-structural-colors).
