# Connect to Microsoft Dynamics CRM with Power BI
Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online for Power BI allows you to easily access and analyze your data. Power BI uses the OData feed to create a descriptive model, with all the entities and measures needed such as Accounts, Activities, Opportunities, Product, Leads, Users and more. After you install the app, you can view the dashboard and reports in the Power BI service ([https://powerbi.com](https://powerbi.com)), and in the Power BI mobile apps.

## What's included
The sections below detail what's included for the [Sales Manager](#Sales) and [Service Manager](#Service) personas.

Note that data in addition is limited based on the security role assigned to the Dynamics CRM Online user.

The dashboard and reports are meant to provide operational reporting on near term data with focus on a team or group. Each query is limited to retrieve a maximum of 100K records from Dynamics CRM Online. If this limit is exceeded due to high volume of data in your organization, provisioning will fail as data refresh Dynamics CRM online will be terminated. If your account is too large, consider connecting through the Power BI Desktop to build a custom solution.

## System requirements
* A valid Dynamics CRM Online 2016 or later instance (Power BI won't work with an on-premises CRM version). If you do not have 2016 or later:
* An administrator must enable the OData endpoint in the site settings.
* An account with less than 100k records in any of the tables. Note if the account has access to more than 100k records the import will fail.

<a name="FindingParams"></a>

## Finding parameters
The address of the instance can be found in the URL bar of your browser. It typically has the format: `https://[instance_name].crm.dynamics.com`.

Power BI only supports Dynamics CRM 2016 endpoints. The connection will not work with earlier versions of CRM Online. Use Power BI Desktop to connect directly to your account.

## Troubleshooting
If you're having trouble connecting, confirm:  

* you're providing the correct instance URL (check with your admin)  
* the instance is CRM Online 2016  
* the OData endpoint is enabled  

Also, try connecting directly in Power BI Desktop, with the OData URL `https://[instance_name].crm.dynamics.com/api/data/v8.0/`.

If you confirm you have Dynamics CRM Online 2016 but you're still hitting issues connecting, contact your CRM Admin to confirm you have all available updates.

If you do not have CRM Online 2016 or later, use the Power BI Desktop to connect directly to your account.

If you see an error "Data refresh failed as query exceeded the maximum limit of 100000 records," consider connecting directly from the Power BI Desktop or leveraging the CRM solution template.
