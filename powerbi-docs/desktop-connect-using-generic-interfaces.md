# Connect to data using generic interfaces in Power BI Desktop
You can connect to a multitude of different data sources in **Power BI Desktop**, using built-in data connectors that range from **Access databases** to **Zendesk** resources, as shown in the **Get Data** window. You can also connect to all sorts of *other* data sources to further expand your connectivity options, by using the generic interfaces (such as **ODBC** or **REST APIs**) built into **Power BI Desktop**.

## Power BI Desktop data interfaces
**Power BI Desktop** includes an ever-growing collection of data connectors that are built to connect to a specific data source. For example, the **SharePoint List** data connector provides specific fields and supporting information during the connection sequence that are designed for **SharePoint Lists**, which is the case with other data sources found in the window that appears when you select **Get Data > More...** (shown in the previous image).

In addition, **Power BI Desktop** lets you connect to data sources that aren't identified in the **Get Data** lists, by using one of the following generic data interfaces:

* **ODBC**
* **OLE DB**
* **OData**
* **REST APIs**
* **R Scripts**

By providing the appropriate parameters in the connection windows that these generic interfaces provide, the world of data sources you can access and use in **Power BI Desktop** grows significantly.

In the following sections, you can find lists of data sources that can be accessed by these generic interfaces.

Can't find the data source you wanted to use with **Power BI Desktop**? Submit your idea to the Power BI team's [list of ideas and requests](https://ideas.powerbi.com/).

## Data sources accessible through ODBC
The **ODBC** connector in **Power BI Desktop** lets you import data from any third-party ODBC driver simply by specifying a **Data Source Name (DSN)** or a *connection string*. As an option, you can also specify a SQL statement to execute against the ODBC driver.

The following list details a few examples of data sources to which **Power BI Desktop** can connect by using the generic **ODBC** interface.

## Data sources accessible through OLE DB
The **OLE DB** connector in **Power BI Desktop** lets you import data from any third-party OLE DB driver simply by specifying a *connection string*. As an option, you can also specify a SQL statement to execute against the OLE DB driver.
