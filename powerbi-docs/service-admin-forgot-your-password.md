# Forgot your password for Power BI?

If you've forgotten your password, you can use the following link to request a password reset.

<https://passwordreset.microsoftonline.com>

If you're told your account isn't set up for password reset, contact your Office 365 admin. If you're using the free trial, the admin is the first person in your organization who signed up.

If you're still having issues accessing your account, you can try contacting the support team for a password reset.

*1-800-642-7676*

It's important to note that this phone number is not the Power BI service support number.

> [!NOTE]
> Power BI provides support during usual business hours in the Eastern Standard Time (EST) time zone. Support is currently only provided in English.
