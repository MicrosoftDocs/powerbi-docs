# Data sources supported by DirectQuery in Power BI

**Power BI Desktop** and the **Power BI service** have many data sources to which you can connect and get access to data. This article describes which data sources for Power BI support the connection method known as **DirectQuery**. For more information about DirectQuery, see [**DirectQuery in Power BI**](desktop-directquery-about.md).

The following data sources support DirectQuery in Power BI:

* Amazon Redshift
* Azure HDInsight Spark (Beta)
* Azure SQL Database
* Azure SQL Data Warehouse
* Google BigQuery (Beta)
* IBM DB2 database
* IBM Netezza (Beta)
* Impala (version 2.x)
* Oracle Database (version 12 and above)
* SAP Business Warehouse Application Server
* SAP Business Warehouse Message Server (Beta)
* SAP HANA
* Snowflake
* Spark (Beta)  (version 0.9 and above)
* SQL Server
* Teradata Database
* Vertica (Beta)

Data sources that have **(Beta)** or **(Preview)** after their name are subject to change, and are not supported for production use. They might also not be supported after publishing a report to the **Power BI service**, which means that opening a published report or exploring the dataset can result in an error.

The only difference between **(Beta)** and **(Preview)** data sources is that **(Preview)** sources must be enabled as a Preview feature before they become available for use. To enable a **(Preview)** data connector, in **Power BI Desktop** go to **File > Options and Settings > Options**, and then select **Preview features**.

> [!NOTE]
> DirectQuery queries to SQL Server require authentication using current Windows authentication credentials or database credentials to establish access. Alternate credentials are not supported.
