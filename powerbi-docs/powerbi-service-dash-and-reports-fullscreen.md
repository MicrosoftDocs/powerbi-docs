# Full Screen mode in Power BI
## What is Full Screen mode?
![dashboard Full Screen mode before and after](media/powerbi-service-dash-and-reports-fullscreen/power-bi-full-screen-comparison.png)

Display your content (dashboards, report pages, tiles, and visualizations) without the distraction of menus and navigation bars.  You get an unadulterated, full view of your content at a glance, all the time. This is sometimes referred to as TV Mode. The functionality available in Full Screen mode varies by content.  

Some uses for Full Screen mode are:

* presenting your dashboard, tile, visual, or report at a meeting or conference
* displaying in an office on a dedicated large screen or projector
* viewing on a small screen
* reviewing in locked mode -- you can touch the screen or mouse over tiles without opening the underlying report or dashboard

> **NOTE**:
> Full Screen mode is different from [Focus (Pop out) mode](service-focus-mode.md).

Watch Amanda open and navigate her dashboard in Full Screen mode and then apply some URL parameters to control the default display. Then follow the step-by-step instructions below the video to try it out yourself.

## Dashboards and report pages in Full Screen mode
1. From the Power BI menu bar above your dashboard or report, select the **Full Screen** icon ![full screen icon ](media/powerbi-service-dash-and-reports-fullscreen/power-bi-full-screen-icon.png) . Your dashboard canvas or report page fills the entire screen. The example below is a dashboard.

2. In Full Screen mode, you have several menu options.  To reveal the menu, just move your mouse or cursor. 
   
     Menu for dashboards

     Menu for report pages    
    ![Menu for reports](media/powerbi-service-dash-and-reports-fullscreen/power-bi-report-menu.png)    
   
    ![Back icon](media/powerbi-service-dash-and-reports-fullscreen/power-bi-back-icon.png)    
    Use the **Back** button  to navigate to the previous page in your browser. If the previous page was a Power BI page, it too will display in Full Screen mode.  Full Screen mode will persist until you exit out.
   
    ![Print icon](media/powerbi-service-dash-and-reports-fullscreen/power-bi-print-icon.png)    
    Use this button to print your dashboard or report page in Full Screen mode. 
   
    ![Fit to screen icon](media/powerbi-service-dash-and-reports-fullscreen/power-bi-fit-to-width.png)    
    Use the **Fit to screen** button to display your dashboard at the largest size possible without resorting to scrollbars.     
   
    ![Fit to screen](media/powerbi-service-dash-and-reports-fullscreen/power-bi-fit-screen.png)
   
    ![Fit to width icon](media/powerbi-service-dash-and-reports-fullscreen/power-bi-fit-width.png)       
    Sometimes you don't care about scrollbars, but want the dashboard to fill the entire width of the available space. Select the **Fit to width** button.

    ![Report navigation icon](media/powerbi-service-dash-and-reports-fullscreen/power-bi-report-nav2.png)       
    In Full Screen reports, use these arrows to move between the pages in the report.    
3. To exit Full Screen mode, select the **Exit Full Screen** icon.

## Visualizations and dashboard tiles in Full Screen mode
1. To display dashboard tiles and report visualizations in Full Screen mode, you must start with that tile or visualization already in [Focus mode](service-focus-mode.md).

2. Then, select the Full screen icon ![full screen icon](media/powerbi-service-dash-and-reports-fullscreen/power-bi-full-screen-icon.png)  for that tile or  visual. The tile or visual will display full screen without menus or navigation bars.
