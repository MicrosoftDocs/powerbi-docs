## Self-study kit

You can download and set up a self-study kit, which consists of the presentation content and eight hands-on labs:

1. Use [this link](https://aka.ms/priad-student) to download the self-study kit (.zip) locally to your PC (Windows 7, or later).
1. Open the file properties of the zip file, and check "unblock" (Windows may flag the file as potentially untrusted).
1. Create a root course folder. We recommend you name it something like "C:\Training". Remember this location, because you'll need to access the course files during the labs. All lab documents refer to this location as **&lt;CourseFolder&gt;**.
1. Extract the **PowerBIPRIAD-Student.zip** file contents to your root course folder.
1. In the **&lt;CourseFolder&gt;\PowerBIPRIAD** folder, open the **ReadMe.txt** file and work through the setup instructions.

> [!TIP]
> The **ReadMe.txt** file, lab documents and presentation file (PDF) are available in English and also the following eight languages:
> - German (de-DE)
> - Spanish (es-ES)
> - French (fr-FR)
> - Italian (it-IT)
> - Japanese (ja-JP)
> - Korean (ko-KR)
> - Portuguese, Brazilian (pt-BR)
> - Chinese, simplified characters (zh-CN)

> [!NOTE]
> You're responsible for having your own Power BI account. If you don't already have one, see [Sign up for Power BI as an individual](../fundamentals/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi.md).
>
> You must sign in to Power BI to publish a Power BI Desktop file to a workspace. The publication results in a dataset that's used as a report data source. You don't need a Power BI Pro license or a Power BI Premium subscription to use a dataset as a report data source.
>
> Some lab tasks involve publishing your paginated report to a workspace. You can only open a paginated report when it's been saved to a workspace on a [capacity](../admin/service-premium-what-is.md#reserved-capacities), which has the paginated reports workload enabled. If you don't have access to a suitable workspace, the lab will provide you with a link to watch a video that demonstrates report publication instead.
