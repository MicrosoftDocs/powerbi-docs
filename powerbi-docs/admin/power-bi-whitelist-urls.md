# Add Power BI URLs to your allow list
[//]: # "suparnap, miwehnia, natham are contacts for maintaining this list"

The Power BI service requires connectivity to the internet. The endpoints listed in the tables in this article should be reachable for customers using the Power BI service.

To use the Power BI service, you must be able to connect to the endpoints marked **required** in the tables below, and to any endpoints marked **required** on the linked sites. If the link to an external site refers to a specific section, you only need to review the endpoints in that section.

Endpoints marked **optional** may also be added to allow lists for specific functionality to work.

The Power BI service requires only TCP Port 443 to be opened for the listed endpoints.

Wildcards (*) represent all levels under the root domain, and we use N/A when information isn't available. The **Destination(s)** column lists domain names and links to external sites, which contain further endpoint information.
