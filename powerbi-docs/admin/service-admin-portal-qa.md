## Synonym sharing
When this setting is enabled, users can share Q&A synonyms as suggested terms with everyone in your organization.

> [!NOTE]
> If you disable this setting and apply the changes, and then later re-enable synonym sharing, it might take a few weeks to reshare all the synonyms within your organization.
