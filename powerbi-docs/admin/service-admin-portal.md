# About the admin portal

The admin portal includes settings that govern Power BI for all users in your organization. For example, you can view usage metrics, access the Microsoft 365 admin center, and control how users interact with Power BI.

The full admin portal can be accessed by global admins and users who have the Power BI administrator role. If you're not in one of these roles, you only see **Capacity settings** in the portal. For more information about the Power BI service administrator role, see [Understanding the Power BI admin role](service-admin-role.md).
