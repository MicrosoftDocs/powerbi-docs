# Get a Power BI subscription for your organization

As an administrator, you can sign up for Power BI through the [Power BI web site](https://powerbi.microsoft.com). You can also sign up through the purchase services page on the Microsoft 365 admin center. When an administrator signs up for Power BI, they can assign licenses to users who should have access.

Additionally, individual users in your organization may be able to sign up for Power BI through the Power BI web site. When a user in your organization signs up for Power BI, that user is assigned a Power BI license automatically. If you want to turn off this capability, follow the steps in [Enable or disable self-service sign-up and purchasing](service-admin-disable-self-service.md).

## Sign up through Power BI

You'll need a work or school account to sign up for a Power BI subscription. We don't support email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunications providers.

Follow these steps to sign up:

1. Go to the [Power BI web site](https://powerbi.microsoft.com). Select **Try free**.
2. Enter your work email address, then select **Sign up**.

4. Select **Yes** to confirm that you are using an email address that you got from your company.
5. Create your account. We send a verification code to your email address to complete signup.
