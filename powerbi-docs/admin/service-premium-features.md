# Power BI Premium features

This article lists the main Power BI Premium features. Most of the features apply to all the Power BI Premium licenses, [Premium Gen2](service-premium-gen2-what-is.md), [Premium (original version)](service-premium-what-is.md) and [Premium Per User (PPU)](service-premium-per-user-faq.yml). When a feature only works with a specific license, the required license is indicated in the *description* field. If no license is listed, the feature works with any license.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>During March 2022, Microsoft will transition all [Premium (original version)](service-premium-what-is.md) capacities to the modern [Premium Gen2](service-premium-gen2-what-is.md) platform.
