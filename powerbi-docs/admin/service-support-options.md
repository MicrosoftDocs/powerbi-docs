# Power BI support options

This article describes the support options that are available to customers who have purchased Power BI Pro, Power BI Premium Per User, and Power BI Premium. Power BI Administrators and other admins in your organization have access to expanded support options. Read [Commonly used Microsoft 365 admin center roles](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles#commonly-used-microsoft-365-admin-center-roles) to learn more about who can manage service requests for your organization.

## Get started with support for end users

If you're an end user, you can contact Support directly if you have a Power BI Pro or Power BI Premium Per User license. But, your administrator may prefer you take a different route to get help. Before you contact support, check these requirements:

1. Find out which license you have. To quickly check whether you're eligible to contact Support, select your profile picture from the page header in [Power BI service](https://app.powerbi.com). If **Pro account** or **Premium Per User account** is displayed, you may use the support options listed below. Select **View account** to see more details about your account.

   > [!NOTE]
   >If you got your Power BI Pro or Power BI Premium Per User license through a guest affiliation with another organization, you can't contact Support. Your license must be assigned directly by the organization that manages your work or school account to enable Support options.

2. Verify whether Power BI Support is your admin's preferred option when you need help. It's easy to check. Select the help menu (**?**) from the page header in Power BI service, then select **Get help**. If this selection takes you to Power BI Support, you may use the support options listed below. Otherwise, you'll be directed to the preferred support option for your organization.
