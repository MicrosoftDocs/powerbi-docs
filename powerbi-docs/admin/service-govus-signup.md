# Enroll your US government organization in the Power BI service

There's a version of the Power BI service as part of the [Microsoft 365 Government plans](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/government/compare-office-365-government-plans?rtc=1). This article is designed for US government customers, and the enrollment process described here is different from the commercial version of the Power BI service.

After you sign up for Power BI US government, work with your account team to start the [allow list process](#additional-signup-information) described in this article. That step is needed to fully enable your organization in the government community cloud.

## Additional signup information

Before you can use US government Power BI services, you have to work with your Microsoft account team to have your organization added to our allow list. The allow list process is used by the Power BI engineering team  to move customers from the commercial cloud environment into the secure, government community cloud. This step ensures that features available in the US government cloud work as expected. 

To start the allow list process, contact your Microsoft account team for assistance. Only administrators can request addition to the allow list. The process takes about three weeks. During this time, the Power BI engineering team makes appropriate changes to ensure your tenant operates properly in the US government cloud.
