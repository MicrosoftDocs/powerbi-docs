# Enroll your US government organization in the Power BI service

If your organization is in GCC, you can use the steps in this article to sign up and purchase services.

## More signup information

Before you can use the Power BI service for the US government, you have to work with your Microsoft account team to have your organization added to our allow list. The allow list process is used by the Power BI engineering team to move customers from the commercial cloud environment into the secure, government community cloud. This step ensures that features available in the US government cloud work as expected.

To start the allow list process, contact your Microsoft account team for assistance. Only administrators can request addition to the allow list. The process takes about three weeks. During this time, the Power BI engineering team makes appropriate changes to ensure your tenant operates properly in the US government cloud.
