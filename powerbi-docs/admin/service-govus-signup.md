This article is designed for US government customers, and the enrollment process described here is different from the commercial version of the Power BI service.

## More signup information

Before you can use Power BI for US government, you have to work with your Microsoft account team to have your organization added to our allow list. The allow list process is used by the Power BI engineering team to move customers from the commercial cloud environment into the secure, government community cloud. This step ensures that features available in the US government cloud work as expected.

To start the allow list process, contact your Microsoft account team for assistance. Only administrators can request addition to the allow list. The process takes about three weeks. During this time, the Power BI engineering team makes appropriate changes to ensure your tenant operates properly in the US government cloud.
