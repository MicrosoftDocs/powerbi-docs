# Data protection in Power BI

##  Data protection in Power BI

>[!VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEx0449K7F8&feature=youtu.be]

Modern enterprises have strict business regulations and requirements about how to handle and protect sensitive data. To provide control and visibility over such business-critical data, Power BI is integrated with [Microsoft Information Protection]( https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels?view=o365-worldwide) and [Microsoft Cloud App Security]( https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/what-is-cloud-app-security). This enables you to:

* Classify and label sensitive Power BI data using the same Microsoft Information Protection sensitivity labels used in Office.

* Enforce governance policies when Power BI content is exported to Excel, PowerPoint, PDF, and other export scenarios, to help ensure that data is protected when it leaves Power BI, even for destinations outside the organizational network or on unmanaged devices.

* Monitor and protect user activity on sensitive data in real time with alerts, session monitoring, and risk remediation using Cloud App Security.

* Empower security administrators who use data protection reports and the security investigation capabilities of Cloud App Security to enhance organizational oversight.
