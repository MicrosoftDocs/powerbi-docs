# Content pack and app tenant settings

These settings are configured in the tenant settings section of the Admin portal. For information about how to get to and use tenant settings, see [About tenant settings](service-admin-portal-about-tenant-settings.md).

## Publish content packs and apps to the entire organization

Admins use this setting to decide which users can publish content packs and apps to the entire organization, rather than specific groups. Learn more about [publishing apps](../collaborate-share/service-create-distribute-apps.md).

The following image shows the **My entire organization** option when creating a content pack.

## Create template apps and organizational content packs

Users in the organization can create template apps and organizational content packs that use datasets built on one data source in Power BI Desktop. Learn more about [template apps](../connect-data/service-template-apps-create.md).

## Push apps to end users

Admins can allow report creators to share apps directly with end users, without requiring installation from [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com). In the admin portal, the setting is **Push apps to end users**. Learn more about [automatically installing apps for end users](../collaborate-share/service-create-distribute-apps.md#automatically-install-apps-for-end-users).
