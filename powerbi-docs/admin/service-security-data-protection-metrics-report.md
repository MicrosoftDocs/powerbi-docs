# Data protection metrics report (preview)

## What is the data protection metrics report?
The data protection metrics report is a dedicated report that [Power BI administrators](../service-admin-role.md) can use to  monitor and track data sensitivity label usage in their tenant.

The report features:
* A 100% stacked column chart that shows daily sensitivity label usage in the tenant for the last 7, 30, or 90 days. This chart makes it easy to track the relative usage of the different label types over time.
* Doughnut charts that show the current state of sensitivity label usage in the tenant for dashboards, reports, datasets, and dataflows.
* A link to the Cloud App Security portal where Power BI alerts, users-at-risk, activity logs, and other information is available. For more information see [Using Microsoft cloud app security controls in Power BI (preview)](./service-security-using-microsoft-cloud-app-security-controls.md).

The report refreshes every 24 hours.
