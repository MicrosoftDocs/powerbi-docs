# Discovery tenant settings

These settings are configured in the tenant settings section of the Admin portal. For information about how to get to and use tenant settings, see [About tenant settings](service-admin-portal-about-tenant-settings.md).

[Discoverability](../collaborate-share/service-discovery.md) is a feature that dataset owners can use to make their endorsed content discoverable by users who don't yet have access to it. See [Discoverability](../collaborate-share/service-discovery.md) for more detail.
