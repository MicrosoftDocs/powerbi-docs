# Add custom branding to the Power BI service

As a Power BI admin, you can change the look and feel of the Power BI service to match your organization's own branding. With custom branding, you can change the theme color that appears in the top navigation bar, add your company logo, and bring your default landing page to life by adding a cover image.
Custom branding changes the look of Power BI for your whole organization. Users can't override your custom branding with their own theme. Custom branding also appears to any external users who have access to your reports in B2B scenarios, helping to easily distinguish your organization.

## Before you begin

- Make sure you're a Power BI Administrator.
- Prepare your images for upload. You'll need these files:
  - A logo file that's saved in .png format, is 10 KB or smaller, and is at least 200 x 30 pixels. Choosing a PNG file makes sure your logo has a high-resolution appearance on all screens and at all zoom levels. The logo appears on every page.
  - A cover image that's saved in .jpg or .png format, is 1 MB or smaller, and is at least 1920 x 160 pixels. Get creative with your choice with an image that complements your theme color and feels welcoming. The cover image appears only at the top of Home.
- Identify the hex or decimal code for your theme color. Your theme color appears on every page and provides the background for your logo. Choose a color that complements your logo and cover image or that matches other custom branding in your organization.

The following image indicates where each of these elements appears in the Power BI service:

1. Logo
1. Cover image
