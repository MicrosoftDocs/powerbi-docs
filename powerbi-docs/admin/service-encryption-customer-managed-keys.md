# Use customer-managed keys in Power BI

Power BI encrypts data at rest and in process. By default, Power BI uses Microsoft-managed keys to encrypt your data. Organizations can choose to use their own keys for encryption of user content at rest across Power BI, from report images to imported datasets in Premium capacities. 

## Why use customer-managed keys

With Power BI customer-managed keys (CMK), organizations can meet compliance requirements for data encryption at rest with their cloud service provider (in this case, Microsoft). CMK is only offered to new Power BI Premium customers and it enables organizations to encrypt their Power BI user content using a key they provide and manage. Revoking a customer-managed key makes user content within Power BI unreadable for everyone within an hour, including Microsoft. Compared to the BYOK offering, CMK also covers user content that is generated by the service, in addition to customer data that is imported into reports and datasets hosted on Premium capacities, it enforces stricter caching policies, and can only apply a single key to encrypt all the data.


## How to use customer-managed keys
To opt in to Power BI customer-managed keys, your organization must contact your organization’s Microsoft account manager to validate that your organization meets certain size requirements that are required for enabling CMK.
