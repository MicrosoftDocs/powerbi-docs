             The Power BI service for EU/EFTA customers, also referred to as Microsoft Cloud Deutschland (MCD), is an EU/EFTA compliant cloud with the Power BI service delivered from German datacenters. All customer data in the Power BI service for EU/EFTA cloud is stored at rest in Germany with T-Systems working as the independent German data trustee, and with physical and logical access to data controlled by German law. The Power BI service for EU/EFTA cloud requires a distinct and separate account from the commercial version of the Power BI service.
