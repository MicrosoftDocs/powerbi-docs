      - question: |

        answer: |
          Power BI Premium recently released a new version of Power BI Premium, **Premium Gen2**. Premium Gen2 simplifies the management of Premium capacities, and reduces management overhead.

      - question: |
          What does Power BI Premium do? How does it work? 
        answer: |
          Power BI Premium consists of capacity in the Power BI service exclusively allocated to each organization. The capacity is supported by dedicated hardware fully managed by Microsoft. Organizations can choose to apply their capacity broadly, or allocate it to assigned workspaces based on the number of users, workload needs, or other factors—and scale up or down as requirements change.

      - question: |
          How is Power BI Pro different than Power BI Premium?  
        answer: |
          Power BI Premium is a capacity-based license, while Power BI Pro and Premium Per User (PPU) are user-based licenses. Power BI Pro is for those users publishing reports, sharing dashboards, collaborating with colleagues in workspaces and engaging in other related activities – such as the ability to:
          
          * Edit and save customized views
          * Create personal dashboards (pin to new dashboard)
          * Analyze data in Excel or Power BI Desktop
          * Share with Excel Web App support
          * Share dashboards and collaborate with Microsoft 365 Groups
          * Integrate content with Microsoft Teams
          
          A Premium Per User (PPU) license includes all the functionality of a Pro user, plus additional capabilities. 
          
      - question: |
          Do I need Power BI Pro to use Power BI Premium?  
        answer: |
          Yes. Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) is required to publish reports, share dashboards, collaborate with colleagues in workspaces and engage in other related activities. Power BI Pro isn't required to consume content in Premium capacity.

      - question: |
          Can you outline a scenario of how Power BI Pro and Power BI Premium work to cover an organization for Modern BI?  
        answer: |
          The following examples outline how customers can meet their BI needs using a combination of Power BI Pro and Power BI Premium.

For more information on nodes and v-cores, see the [Microsoft Power BI Premium whitepaper](https://aka.ms/pbipremiumwhitepaper).

      - question: |
          What is Power BI Report Server? Does this mean you're making Power BI available on-premises?
        answer: |
          Power BI Report Server is an on-premises server that allows the deployment and distribution of interactive Power BI reports, and paginated reports, completely within the boundaries of the organization's firewall. Power BI Report Server is available through Power BI Premium or as a benefit for customers with SQL Server Enterprise Edition with Software Assurance. For information about licensing, see [Licensing Power BI Report Server](../report-server/get-started.md#licensing-power-bi-report-server). Contact your Microsoft representative for details.
          
          With Power BI Premium, the same number of virtual cores an organization provisions in the cloud can also be deployed on-premises through Power BI Report Server. There is no need to split the capacity. Organizations can choose Power BI in the cloud, or elect to keep reports on-premises with Power BI Report Server and move to the cloud at their pace.
          
          For more information, see [Get started with Power BI Report Server](../report-server/get-started.md).
