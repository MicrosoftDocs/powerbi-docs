# Migrate your subscription to the new Local German regions

If you're an existing Microsoft Cloud Germany (Microsoft Cloud Deutschland) customer, you can move your Power BI users to new Local German regions. The following services will be migrated as part of this approach:

* Power BI

## Opt in to migration

To start the migration process, the first step is to [opt-in to a Microsoft-assisted migration](/microsoft-365/enterprise/ms-cloud-germany-migration-opt-in) to our new German datacenter regions.

Opt-in to the Microsoft-driven migration for Power BI is happening now. When we're ready to start your migration, we'll inform you through Message center in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

After the subscription migration is complete, we'll lower pricing to match public cloud pricing. Direct customers will see a new subscription with a new annual renewal date.

We'll keep on updating this article in the coming months to add detailed information about prerequisites, step-by-step procedures, and any effect the migration will have on your organization.

## Microsoft Cloud Deutschland transition

We provide two cloud datacenter regions in Germany, offering in-country customer data residency and full connectivity to Microsoft’s global cloud network. These regions are now live with the general availability of Azure, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Power Platform. As a result, we closed the Microsoft Cloud Deutschland. For more information, see [Microsoft Cloud Deutschland transition](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/germany-cloud-regions).
