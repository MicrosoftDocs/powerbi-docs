# Migrate your subscription to the new "Go Local" German regions

If you're an existing Microsoft Cloud Germany (Microsoft Cloud Deutschland) customer, you'll soon be able to move your Power BI users to new “Go Local” German regions. To start the migration process, the first step is to [opt-in to a Microsoft-assisted migration](https://aka.ms/office365germanymoveoptin) to our new German datacenter regions.

If your organization opts in, you can expect migration to begin sometime in 2020. Your core customer data and subscriptions will migrate to the new “Go Local” German regions.

After your subscription migrates, we'll lower pricing to match public cloud pricing. Direct customers will see a new subscription with a new annual renewal date. The following services will be migrated as part of this approach:

* Power BI

We'll keep on updating this article in the coming months to add detailed information about prerequisites, step-by-step procedures, and any effect the migration will have on your organization.
