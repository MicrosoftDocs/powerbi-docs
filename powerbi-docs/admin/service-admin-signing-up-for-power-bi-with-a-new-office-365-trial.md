# Signing up for Power BI with a new Microsoft 365 Trial

This article describes an alternative way to sign up for Power BI, if you don't already have a work or school email account. 

If you're having problems signing up for Power BI with your email address, first make sure it's an [email address that can be used with Power BI](../fundamentals/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi.md#supported-email-addresses). If that's not successful, sign up for a Microsoft 365 trial and create a work account. Then, use that new work account to sign up for the Power BI service. You'll be able to use Power BI even after the Microsoft 365 trial expires.

> [!NOTE]
> Office 365 was recently rebranded as Microsoft 365. Until all of our articles are updated, you may still see it referred to as Office 365.

1. Sign up for a Microsoft 365 trial [on the Microsoft 365 web site](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business/compare-more-office-365-for-business-plans).

    ![enter your contact info](media/service-admin-signing-up-for-power-bi-with-a-new-office-365-trial/power-bi-welcome-you.png)

    

1. Create your new work sign-in name that looks like you@yourcompany.onmicrosoft.com. This is the sign-in you'll use with Power BI.

1. You may have to wait while your new tenant gets created. 

That's it!  You now have an email address that you can use to sign up for Power BI. Head on over to [Sign up for the Power BI service as an individual](../fundamentals/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi.md)





## Important considerations
If you have any issues signing in with the new account, try using a private browser session.    

By using this signup method, you are creating a new organizational tenant and you'll become the administrator of the tenant. For more information, see [What is Power BI administration?](service-admin-administering-power-bi-in-your-organization.md). You can add new users to your tenant, then share with them, as described in the [Microsoft 365 admin documentation](https://support.office.com/en-sg/article/Add-users-individually-to-Office-365---Admin-Help-1970f7d6-03b5-442f-b385-5880b9c256ec).
