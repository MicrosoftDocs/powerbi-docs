# Request or grant access to shared dashboards or reports

If someone sends you a link to a dashboard or a report, but it's not shared with you, you can request access. If you share a dashboard or a report with someone, you need to [grant them access](#grant-access).

## Request access

1. Select the link to the report or dashboard. If you see a **Request access** message, select **OK**.

1. In the **Request access** dialog, you can provide a reason, or just select **Send request**.

    You see a confirmation that Power BI has sent your request.

## Grant access

If you're a report owner, you might receive an email from **Microsoft Power BI** saying that someone has requested access to your report.

1. In the email, select **Grant access**.

   The user’s **Pending** access request opens automatically. Select one of the options:

   - **Admin** to grant the user *Read* permissions to the report.
   - **Member**
   - **Contributor**
   - Or **Remove** them.

1. After you've approved the user’s request, you can select the **Direct access** tab to modify their permissions and give them **Reshare** permissions as well.
