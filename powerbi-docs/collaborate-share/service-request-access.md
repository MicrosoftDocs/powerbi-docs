# Request or grant access to shared dashboards or reports

If someone sends you a link to a dashboard or a report, but it's not shared with you, you can request access. 

## Request access

1. Select the link to the report or dashboard. If you see a "Request access" message, select **OK**.

    You see a confirmation that Power BI has sent your request.

## Grant access

If you're a report owner, you may receive an email from **Microsoft Power BI** saying that someone has requested access to your report.

1. Select **Grant access**.

    The user’s **Pending** access request opens automatically. Select **Approve** to grant the user Read permissions to the report.

1. After you've approved the user’s request, you can select the **Direct access** tab to modify their permissions and give them **Reshare** permissions as well.
