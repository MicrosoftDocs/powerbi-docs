    questions:
      - question: |
          I can’t use the subscription feature  
        answer: |
          The **Subscribe** option is missing or greyed out.
          
          ### Contact your Power BI administrator or IT help desk
          
          - If you can’t use the subscription feature, contact your Power BI administrator, or IT help desk. Your organization may have disabled this feature, generally or specifically for external users, or a maximum subscriber limit may have been reached. 
          
          - Your organization may configure certain settings in Microsoft Entra ID that limit the ability to use email subscriptions in Power BI. These limitations include, but aren't limited to, having multifactor authentication or IP range restrictions when accessing resources. 

           ### You're an internal guest user. You have an account in the organization's Entra directory, but you only have guest-level access in that organization.  
          
          ### You've reached the maximum of 24 subscriptions
          There's a limit of 24 subscriptions per Power BI report or dashboard. You can provide unique recipients, times, and frequencies for each subscription. Paginated reports don't have this limit. 
          
      - question: |
          I’ve stopped receiving a subscription 
        answer: |
          I've set up a subscription but am not receiving the subscription emails.

          ### Account or license issues

          A subscription will end if the Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) license expires, the report or dashboard is deleted by the owner, or the user account used to create the subscription is deleted. 
          
          ### Email issues
          - To avoid subscription emails going to your spam folder, add the Power BI email alias (no-reply-powerbi@microsoft.com) to your contacts. If you're using Microsoft Outlook, right-click the alias and select **Add to Outlook contacts**. 
          
          - Subscriptions may fail on reports or dashboards with extremely large images due to email size limits. 
          
          - Make sure that your User Principal Name (UPN) can receive emails. 
          
          - Though you have a Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) license, you may not have a Microsoft Exchange license. If not, your Microsoft Entra account may not have an email, or alternate email address specified. In this case, though the subscription appears to go out, you never receive a copy. If your Power BI admin assigns an email address, Power BI will synchronize the update the next time you sign in, and use that email address for the subscription. 
          - If you have an alternate email address but no primary, Power BI uses that to deliver the subscription. 
          
          ### Admin portal settings
          - If your admin has enabled the tenant setting for **Block Public Internet Access**, then email subscriptions with full report attachment (FRA) or report preview aren't delivered.  

      - question: |
          The links in my email subscription no longer work

        answer: |
          If the links in your email (to the content) stop working, it may be that the content was deleted. In the email, beneath the screenshot, you can look to see if you subscribed yourself or if someone else subscribed you. If someone else, ask that coworker to either cancel the emails or resubscribe you.

      - question: |
          The language in my subscription isn't correct  

        answer: |
          The email and snapshot use the language set in Power BI settings (see [Supported languages and countries/regions for Power BI](../fundamentals/supported-languages-countries-regions.md)). If **Default (browser language)** is selected, Power BI uses U.S. English as a fallback for your subscription. To avoid using U.S. English, set your language preference to a specific language. To see or set your language preference, select the cog icon ![gear icon](./media/end-user-subscribe/power-bi-settings-icon.png) > **Settings > General > Language**. 

          ![Screenshot of general tab of Settings showing the language dropdown.](./media/end-user-subscribe/power-bi-languages.png)

      - question: |
          My dashboard subscription is missing tiles 
        answer: |
          You receive your subscription email, open the dashboard, and notice that one or more tiles are missing

          ### Too many dashboard tiles
          Dashboards with more than 25 pinned tiles, or four pinned live report pages, may not render fully in subscription emails sent to users. We suggest that you contact the dashboard designer and ask them to reduce pinned tiles to less than 25 and pinned live reports to less than four to ensure that the email renders correctly. 

          ### Tile type not supported
          For dashboard subscriptions, certain types of tiles aren't yet supported. These tiles include: streaming tiles, video tiles, custom web content tiles. 

      - question: |
          My subscription is delayed  
        answer: |
          You notice that your subscription emails aren't being delivered as expected. 

          ### Periods of peak demand
          The time you set your subscription to begin is when the subscription starts to process. Once the report processing is complete, the subscription is queued and sent to the e-mail recipients. At times of peak demand, you may see a delay, but not more than 15 minutes. On rare occasion, it may take up to 30 minutes, but should never exceed 60 minutes. If you experience a longer delay, ensure that the address no-reply-powerbi@microsoft.com is on the safe sender list. Another recommendation is to run your data refresh and email subscriptions at different times to ensure timely delivery. If the issue persists, contact your Power BI administrator, or IT help desk for assistance. 
          
          
          ### Email software is blocking delivery
          Another possibility is that your email software is blocking the Power BI sender. To avoid subscription emails going to your spam folder, add the Power BI email alias (no-reply-powerbi@microsoft.com) to your contacts. If you're using Microsoft Outlook, right-click the alias and select **Add to Outlook contacts**. 

      - question: |
          Issues with subscriptions set to run after data refresh
        answer: |
          I'm not receiving subscription emails each time my data refreshes. 

          ### Check the **Frequency** setting for your subscription
          Subscriptions set to **After Data Refresh** for the report or dashboard will only send an email after the first scheduled refresh on that day. 
          
          ### Your data uses a live connection
          For your reports with live connections, for example a live connection to Analysis Services, Power BI checks the Analysis Services instance for changes. If you have the subscription set to run after data refreshes, it will run the first time the Power BI service detects a change in your on-premises model. Power BI checks every hour for a change in the Analysis Services data model, to determine when to send the subscription. 
          
          
          ### I'm not getting subscription emails because my data isn't refreshing
          You are able to refresh the report page but not the dataset. Only the dataset owner can manually refresh a dataset. To look up the owner name of the underlying dataset(s), open the report and select the dropdown from the menu bar.
             
          ![find the owner](./media/end-user-subscribe/power-bi-owner.png)

      - question: |
          My subscription has more than 200 recipients 

        answer: |
          There's a limit to the number of subscribers for one report or dashboard. After you pass 200 subscribers, you may encounter issues with delivery. To reduce the number, use group email aliases instead. Each email alias counts as one subscriber. 

      - question: |
          I get an error that my subscription has more than 20 pages
        answer: |
          You may get an error message that the report has more than 20 pages even though your view of the report shows less than 20. One reason for this is that the report designer has hidden pages in the report. When Power BI counts the report pages, it includes hidden pages in that count.

      - question: |
          How do I access the report or dashboard in the Power BI service? 
        answer: |
          You can choose to give subscription recipients access to open and view the content in Power BI by selecting **Permission to access the report or dashboard in Power BI** and whether to include a link to this content by selecting **Link to report or dashboard in Power BI**. 

          ### Recipients don't have access to the report or dashboard
          If you choose to include a link, ensure that all users also have access to the content. Subscribed users receive report attachments, with data based on your permissions. 
          
          :::image type="content" source="media/end-user-subscribe/power-bi-permissions.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing two options selected under the heading Also include.":::
          
          ### I removed access for others, but they can still open the report or dashboard
          Clearing the **Permission to access the report/dashboard in Power BI** option doesn't revoke access for users who have already been granted access this report in the Power BI service (app.powerbi.com). To remove access, see [Manage permissions to a dashboard](../collaborate-share/service-share-dashboards.md#manage-permissions-to-a-dashboard) and see  [Manage permissions to a report](../collaborate-share/service-share-dashboards.md#manage-permissions-to-a-report).

      - question: |
          On a mobile device, the email link opens the app instead of the Power BI service website

        answer: |
          ### If you have the Power BI app installed, this is expected behavior
          When you receive the subscription email, it includes a link to **Go to report or dashboard**. On mobile devices with Power BI apps installed, selecting this link launches the app (as opposed to the default action of opening the report or dashboard on the Power BI website).


      - question: |
          I can't create a report attachment, full report attachment greyed out

        answer: |
          The full report attachment feature is available for reports that meet the following four conditions. 
          Any existing subscriptions with full reports as attachments that don't meet these conditions are 
          disabled and you receive an email explaining the error. 
        
          - They're in an upgraded workspace with [Power BI Premium](../enterprise/service-premium-what-is.md) or Premium Per User. 
          - The report has fewer than 20 pages (see [this issue described above](#i-get-an-error-that-my-subscription-has-more-than-20-pages)).
          - The attachment file is under 25 MB in size.
          - You aren't an owner of the report.

      - question: |
          The subscription times out after 60 minutes
        answer: |
          Subscriptions use the export feature to render the report in the desired format. Export of reports are limited to 60 minutes, the life of the users' access token.
  
      - question: |
          Which Power BI features aren't supported in subscriptions
        answer: |
          There are certain Power BI features that don't work when using the subscription feature.

          * For dashboard subscriptions, if any tiles have row level security (RLS) applied, those tiles won't display.

          * Dataset refresh operations using an XMLA endpoint. 

          * For dashboard subscriptions, certain types of tiles aren't yet supported. These tiles include: streaming tiles, video tiles, custom web content tiles.

          * Certain Power BI visuals aren't supported.  When you subscribe to a report containing these visuals, they display an error symbol.
