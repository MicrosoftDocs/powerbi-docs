# Use Power BI in Microsoft Outlook and Office (preview)

The Power BI app is available in Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Office as a public preview. This integration allows you to access and work with Power BI content directly within Outlook and Office applications.

> [!NOTE]
> Looking for Power BI integration with Microsoft Teams? See [Collaborate with Power BI in Microsoft Teams](service-collaborate-microsoft-teams.md).

## Installation

If you've installed the Power BI app in Microsoft Teams, it's also installed in Outlook and Office. Otherwise, in Outlook and Office you can install the Power BI app from the store. When you install the app, it also appears in Teams. The Power BI app in Teams continues to be generally available.

The Power BI app supports Outlook for the web and Outlook for Windows.

## Requirements

To participate in the preview, you must meet the following requirements:

- You must be enrolled in Microsoft 365 First Release for web experiences.
- For Windows experiences, you must be enrolled in Office Insiders Beta Channel.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The public preview is rolling out incrementally for First Release and Office Insiders users. This means some users in your organization might not yet see the experiences in Outlook and Office.

## Known limitations

In Outlook and Office, the preview app has the following limitations:

- File downloads are not supported yet. This means export options and file downloads do not download files.
- On the **Create** tab, the **Paste or manually enter data** option is not supported yet.
- Viewing items in full screen option is not supported yet.
