# Enable the Power BI/Power Apps Solutions integration (preview)

The Power BI/Power Apps solutions integration enables Power Apps app makers to add Power BI reports and semantic models as Dataverse components in Power Apps solutions, and to seamlessly manage that content as part of their Application Lifecycle Management process across environments and tenants.

For the integration to work, the Power Platform Solutions Integration (Preview) must be **Enabled**, both on the Power BI side and on the Power Platform side. It's enabled on both sides by default. By default, cross-geo operations are also enabled. In order for cross-geo operation to work, cross-geo operation **must** be enabled on both sides.

## Enable the Power BI/Power Apps Solutions integration in Power BI

* For information about enabling the integration on the Power BI side, see [Power Platform Solutions Integration (Preview)](/fabric/admin/service-admin-portal-integration#power-platform-solutions-integration-preview).

* For information about enabling cross-geo operations on the Power BI side, see [Power Platform interregional access](/fabric/admin/service-admin-portal-integration#power-platform-interregional-access). For cross-geo operations to work, interregional information sharing must also be enabled on the Power Platform side.
