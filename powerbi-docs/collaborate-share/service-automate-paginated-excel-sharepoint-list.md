# Export a paginated report for each row in an Excel Online table or SharePoint list

With [Power Automate](/power-automate/getting-started), you can automate exporting and distributing Power BI paginated reports to various supported formats and scenarios. In this article, you use a Power Automate template to automate setting up recurring exports of single or multiple paginated reports. You export them in a desired format for each row in an Excel Online table or SharePoint Online list. You can distribute the exported paginated report to OneDrive for work or school or a SharePoint Online site, or email it via Office 365 Outlook.

Each row in your Excel Online table or SharePoint Online list can represent a single user to receive a paginated report on a subscription basis. Or instead, each row can represent a unique paginated report you wish to distribute. Your table or list requires a column that specifies how to distribute a report, whether OneDrive, SharePoint Online, or Outlook. The Power Automate flow uses this column in its Switch statement.
