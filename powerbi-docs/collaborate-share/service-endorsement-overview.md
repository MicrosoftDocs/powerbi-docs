# Endorsement - Promoting and certifying Power BI content

## Endorsement overview

Organizations often have large amounts of Power BI content available for sharing and reuse by their Power BI users, and identifying trustworthy, authoritative content can be difficult. Endorsement is a way to make it easier for users to find the high-quality content they need. Endorsed content is clearly labeled, both in Power BI and in other places where users look for Power BI content (such as Excel). It is also given priority in some searches, and can be sorted for in many lists.

The image below illustrates how endorsed content (promoted and certified) is clearly identified when you're searching for a dataset to build a report on.

## What kinds of endorsement are there?

There are two kinds of endorsement: **promotion** and **certification**.

### Promotion
Promotion enables users to highlight content that they think is valuable, worthwhile, and ready for others to use. It encourages the collaborative spread of content within the organization. Any content owner, or any member with write permissions on the workspace where the content is located, can simply promote the content when they think it's good enough for sharing.

### Certification

Certification means that the content meets the organization's quality standards and can be regarded as reliable, authoritive content that is ready for use across the organization. Only a select group of reviewers (defined by the Power BI administrator) is authorized to certify content. Content owners who wish to see their content certified and are not authorized to certify it themselves need to follow their organization's guidelines about getting their content certified.

**Certification is available only if a Power BI administrator has enabled and configured it for your organization**.

## What kinds of content can be endorsed?
Power BI currently supports endorsement for:
* Datasets
* Dataflows
* Reports
* Apps

## How can I tell if content has been endorsed?

Endorsed content is labeled with badges and icons in lists, cards, and other places, both in Power BI and in places such as Excel where it is possible to find Power BI content. The following badges and icons identify endorsed content.

|Badge|Icon|

In addition, if you are in a report or an app, you can see the endorsement status via the header.
* Certification is indicated in both in the header and in the header drop down, where you can also see who did the certification.

* Promotion is indicated in the header drop down only.
