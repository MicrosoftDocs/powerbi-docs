# Save a paginated report to OneDrive for work or school or SharePoint Online

With [Power Automate](/power-automate/getting-started), you can automate exporting and distributing Power BI paginated reports to a variety of supported formats and scenarios. In this article, you use Power Automate to automate saving a Power BI paginated report to OneDrive for work or school or a SharePoint Online folder.

For more information about Power Automate templates for Power BI paginated reports, see [Export Power BI paginated reports with Power Automate](service-automate-paginated-integration.md). 

## Prerequisites  

Before you begin, make sure you meet these criteria:

- You can publish to My Workspace, or you have at least a [Contributor role](../collaborate-share/service-roles-new-workspaces.md#workspace-roles) for any other workspace.
- You have access to the standard connectors in Power Automate, which come with any Office 365 subscription.

## Save a paginated report to OneDrive for work or school or a SharePoint Online folder 

With either of these templates, you set up recurring exports of a paginated report in a desired format to OneDrive for work or school or a SharePoint Online folder. See the prerequisites if this is your first time using the Export to File for Paginated Reports action in a Power Automate flow. 

> [!NOTE]
> The following steps and images show setting up a flow using the **Save a Power BI paginated report to OneDrive for work or school** template. Follow the same steps to create a flow using the **Save a Power BI paginated report to a SharePoint Online folder** template. When selecting where you want to export your paginated report, select a SharePoint Online folder instead of a OneDrive for work or school folder. 

1. Go to [flow.microsoft.com](https://flow.microsoft.com/) and sign in to Power Automate. 
1. Select **Templates**, and search for **paginated reports**.

1. Select **Save a Power BI paginated report to OneDrive for work or school** or **Save a Power BI paginated report to a SharePoint Online folder**. Make sure you're signed into Power BI and OneDrive for work or school or SharePoint Online.

    :::image type="content" source="media/service-automate-paginated-onedrive-sharepoint/onedrive-template-step-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting the Power BI and OneDrive for work or school template.":::

1. In the **Workspace** box, select a workspace in a reserved capacity. In the **Report** box, select the paginated report in the selected workspace you wish to export. In the **Export Format** box, select the desired export format. Optionally, you can specify parameters for the paginated report. For detailed descriptions of the API parameters, see the [connector reference for the Power BI REST API](/connectors/powerbi/#export-to-file-for-paginated-reports).

1. Power Automate automatically generates a **File Name** and **File Content** for you. You can change the file name, but keep the dynamically generated **File Content** value. 

1. When you're done, select **Next step** or **Save**. Power Automate creates and evaluates the flow, and lets you know if it finds errors. 

1. If there are errors, select **Edit flow** to fix them. Otherwise, select the **Back** arrow to view the flow details and run the new flow. 

    When you run the flow, Power Automate exports a paginated report in the specified format to OneDrive for work or school or SharePoint Online.
