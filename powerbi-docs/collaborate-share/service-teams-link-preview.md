# Get a Power BI link preview in Microsoft Teams

When a link to a Power BI report, app, dashboard, scorecard, or workspace is created in Power BI and then pasted into a Teams chat or channel, a preview card for the link is generated in the chat/channel window. The preview card shows information about the linked-to item, and, in certain circumstances, includes a Copilot summary button that can be used to get a sense of what the report is about, and whether it's worth opening for further exploration.

The card shows:

* Item name

* Item location: The location indicates whether the link links to the report directly, or indirectly as part of the URL of an org app. For example:
   
   * Workspace > \<report_name\> indicates that the link points directly to the report.
   
   * Apps > \<app_name\> indicates that the report is being pointed to as part of a URL for an app.	

* Open button: Opens the item in the Power BI app in Teams.

* Copilot button: Opens the item in the Power BI app in Teams, with the summary displayed in the Copilot pane. The Open Copilot summary button only appears if Copilot requirements are met. 

* Subscribe: Navigates the user to the Subscriptions pane in the Power BI Teams app, where they can create a subscription for the item.

* Open to access: If the user doesnâ€™t have access to the item, the card will have an Open to access button the user can use to request access.



## Supported items


## Copilot requirements

In order for the Open in Copilot button to appear on the preview card the following requirements must be met:

* The user must have the appropriate licenses.

* The linked to item must be eligble for the Copilot button according to Power BI requirements.
