# Get a Power BI link preview in Microsoft Teams

When you paste a link to your reports, dashboards, and apps into the Microsoft Teams message box, the link preview shows information about the link. Link previews are provided for the following items in Power BI:

- Reports
- Dashboards
- Apps

See [Collaborate in Microsoft Teams with Power BI](service-collaborate-microsoft-teams.md) for background on how Power BI and Microsoft Teams work together, including requirements you need to meet.
