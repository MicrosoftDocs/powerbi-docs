# Collaborate and share Power BI reports and dashboards

Power BI offers several ways to collaborate and share Power BI reports, dashboards, and data with othersâ€”inside or outside your organization. This article explains the main sharing and collaboration options, when to use each, and how to manage permissions.

## Prerequisites

- You need a [Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) license](../fundamentals/service-features-license-type.md) to share content, unless the content is in a [Premium capacity](../enterprise/service-premium-what-is.md).
- Recipients also need a Power BI Pro or PPU license, unless the content is in a Premium or Fabric capacity.
- To let recipients edit a shared report, assign them a workspace role that allows editing. See [Roles in workspaces](service-roles-new-workspaces.md) for details.

> [!NOTE]
> - Only **P SKU**s and **F SKU**s F64 or larger let users with a Microsoft Fabric free license and the Viewer role use Power BI apps and shared content. Smaller **F SKU**s require a Pro license.
> - The **F SKU** is part of Fabric. To learn more, see [Microsoft Fabric licenses](/fabric/enterprise/licenses).

## Ways to collaborate and share

### Share reports and dashboards

- Share from My Workspace or other workspaces (with the right role or permissions).
- [Share from the Power BI mobile apps](../consumer/mobile/mobile-share-dashboard-from-the-mobile-apps.md).
- [Share from Power BI Desktop](../create-reports/desktop-sharepoint-save-share.md) with OneDrive and SharePoint integration.
- [Publish reports from Power BI Desktop](../create-reports/desktop-upload-desktop-files.md) to the Power BI service.

1. In a list of reports or dashboards, or when viewing one, select **Share**.
1. In the **Send link** dialog, choose how to share:
   - **People in your organization**: Anyone in your org with the link can view (not for external/guest users).
   - **Specific people**: Enter names or emails to share directly (can include Microsoft Entra B2B guests).
   - **People with existing access**: Send a link to someone who already has access.
1. Set permissions:
   - **Reshare**: Allow recipients to share with others.
   - **Build**: Allow recipients to build their own reports based on the data.
1. Copy the link or send it directly via email, Outlook, PowerPoint, or Teams.

> [!NOTE]
> Your organization might restrict shareable links to "People in your organization." See [tenant settings](/fabric/admin/service-admin-portal-export-sharing#allow-shareable-links-to-grant-access-to-everyone-in-your-organization).

### Workspaces

- Use workspaces to collaborate on content with a team.
- Assign roles (Admin, Member, Contributor, Viewer) to control access and editing.
- Content in workspaces can be published as apps for broader distribution.

### Publish apps

- Package dashboards and reports into an app for easy distribution.
- Share apps with large groups or your entire organization.
- Recipients get a consistent, read-only experience unless you grant build permissions.

### Microsoft Teams integration

- Share reports and dashboards directly in Teams channels or chats.
- Collaborate in real time and discuss insights with your team.

### Share outside your organization

- Enter the external user's email address (Microsoft Entra B2B guests recommended).
- Recipients must sign in to Power BI to view shared content.
- Only direct recipients can access the shared content; forwarding the link does not grant access.
- If RLS is implemented, external users only see data they're permitted to view.

See [Microsoft Entra B2B guest users](../enterprise/service-admin-azure-ad-b2b.md) for more.

### Share with large groups

- Use security groups to share with large audiences.
- Or, create an app from a workspace and publish it to many users. See [publishing apps in Power BI](service-create-distribute-apps.md).

## Manage permissions

1. Select **More options (...)** in the sharing dialog, then **Manage permissions**.
1. In the **Manage permissions** pane, you can:
   - Copy or change existing links
   - Grant or remove direct access
   - View pending requests and related content
   - Use **Advanced** for more options

> [!NOTE]
> Each report can't have more than 1,000 sharing links. If you reach this limit, remove links for "Specific people" and grant those users direct access.

## Considerations and limitations

- Only reports can be shared via links that grant access; dashboards require direct access.
- Sharing a report or dashboard also shares the underlying semantic model unless RLS is applied.
- Recipients can interact with content in Reading view but can't edit unless granted build permissions.
- Analyze in Excel access can be restricted by admins.
- You can't share reports distributed to you in an app; ask the app owner to add users and republish.
- Distribution groups can be used for sharing, but Microsoft 365 Unified groups are not supported for direct sharing.
- If coworkers already have access, you can send a direct link by copying the URL.
- Email notifications are only sent to individual users, not groups.
