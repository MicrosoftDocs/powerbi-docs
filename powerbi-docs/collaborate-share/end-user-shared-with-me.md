# View Shared Dashboards and Reports in Power BI

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-yyny](../includes/consumer-appliesto-yyny.md)]

Your colleagues create apps, reports, dashboards, scorecards, workspaces, and semantic models. When it's time to share these items with you or ask for your collaboration, they can use several methods. This article explains how to view and open content that others shared with you.

## Interact with shared content

You have options for interacting with the shared dashboards and reports, depending on the permissions the *designer* gives you. These interactions include being able to make copies of the dashboard, subscribe, edit a report, and reshare with other colleagues. For more information, see [Share Power BI reports and dashboards with coworkers and others](service-share-dashboards.md).

## Licenses for viewing shared content

To view content that others share with you, choose from two options.

- **The content isn't in a Power BI Premium capacity**: All business users need Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) licenses to view shared content.
- **The content is in a Power BI Premium capacity**: Business users without Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) licenses can view the content. However, you can't copy the reports or create reports based on the underlying semantic models. For more information, see [What is Power BI Premium?](../enterprise/service-premium-what-is.md)

## View and open content from your *Shared with me* tab

Content that others directly share with you appears in your **Shared with me** tab. You receive a link to shared content in an email link. The *creator* or *owner* can also automatically install the shared content for you. To display the list, select **Browse > Shared with me** from the nav pane. Scroll through **Shared with me** to see reports, dashboards, and scorecards.

From this list, you can [favorite](../consumer/end-user-favorite.md) and open content.

If your **Shared with me** content list gets long, use several options to find what you need. Sort by one of the columns (1), use the keyword filter field (2), or use the Filters pane (3). To open the Filters pane, select **Filters** from the upper right corner.

## Open shared content from an email link

When designers create or update content, they often share that content in an email. An email link gives you direct access to a single piece of content, such as a report or an app. Select the link to open and install the content.

## View and open content from your *Apps* tab

Your **Apps** tab shows apps that others share directly with you and apps you download. You get these apps in one of the following ways:

1. You receive the app as a link in an email, and you select the link.
1. The app *creator* or *owner* automatically installs the app for you.
1. You install the app from [AppSource](../consumer/end-user-apps.md#get-a-new-app).

Scroll through **Apps** to see reports, dashboards, and scorecards. To display the list, select the **Apps** icon from the nav pane.

For more information, see [Apps in Power BI](../consumer/end-user-apps.md).

## Collaborate on content in a *workspace*

*Creators* can share content by granting you a [role](service-roles-new-workspaces.md) in a workspace. What you can do with the content in that workspace depends on the role assigned to you: Viewer, Contributor, Member, or Admin.
