# What's new in the Power BI add-in for PowerPoint

## December 2023

### Suggested content

It's just gotten easier to find and insert the Power BI reports you need for your presentation. Now, when you add the Power BI add-in to your slide, the add-in automatically scans the title of the slide and suggests Power BI content that might be relevant. Let's say the title of your slide is "New stores sales", for example. The add-in will show you a list of Power BI reports that contain data about sales. The add-in also shows you Power BI reports you've recently visited. This makes it easy to access reports you're working on or frequently use.

## February 2023

### Add individual live Power BI visuals to your PowerPoint slides

Ever want to put just a single live visual on a slide? Well, now it's super easy. Just right click on the visual and choose **Open in PowerPoint** to open a new presentation with the visual already loaded into the add-in. If you're adding the visual to an existing presentation, choose **Link to selection** to get the visual's URL for pasting into the add-in in the existing presentation. You can do the same from the **More options (...)** menu. Check out the [documentation](./service-power-bi-powerpoint-add-in-install.md#get-the-url-of-a-visual) for details!

### Enhance your presentations with Power BI data insights

Power BI's data insights help you find and explore insights such as anomalies and trends as you consume and interact with your data. Now with the add-in, you can easily generate insights, which you can then either paste directly into your slide or copy to the clipboard for pasting elsewhere, such as in the slide's notes.
