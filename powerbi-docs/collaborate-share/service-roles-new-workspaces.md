# Roles in workspaces in Power BI

*Workspaces* are places to collaborate with colleagues and create collections of dashboards, reports, semantic models, and paginated reports. This article describes the different roles in workspaces, and what people in each role can do. For more information, see [workspaces in Power BI](service-new-workspaces.md).

To create a new workspace, see [Create a workspace](service-create-the-new-workspaces.md).

Roles let you manage who can do what in a workspace, so teams can collaborate. Workspaces allow you to assign roles to individuals, and also to user groups such as security groups, Microsoft 365 groups, and distribution lists.

To grant access to a workspace, assign one of the following workspace roles to a user group or individual: Admin, Member, Contributor, or Viewer. For more information, see [Give users access to workspaces](service-give-access-new-workspaces.md).

Everyone in a user group gets the role that you assign. If someone is in several user groups, they get the highest level of permission that's provided by the roles that they're assigned. If you nest user groups and assign a role to a group, all the contained users get that role's permissions. All these capabilities, except viewing and interacting, require a Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) license. For more information, see [licensing](#licenses).

> [!NOTE]
>
> - You can assign users to roles, either alone or in a group, even if they can't use the role. In other words, you can assign users who don't have Power BI Pro or PPU licenses to a role that requires a license. See [Licenses](#licenses) for details.
> - Use the Viewer role to enforce [row-level security (RLS)](/fabric/security/service-admin-row-level-security) for users who browse content in a workspace. You can also enforce RLS without giving access to the workspace, [publish an app](service-create-distribute-apps.md) and distribute it to those users, or use [sharing to distribute content](service-share-dashboards.md).
> - Members can add users to a workspace with lower permissions, but can't remove users from any workspace roles. To change an existing user's role (for example, upgrading a Viewer to Contributor), a member must first have an admin remove the user, then the member can add them back with the new role.
> - If a user is deleted from Microsoft Entra ID, their Power BI workspace permissions are removed 30 days after the deletion from Entra. 

## Licenses

If one of the workspaces is in a shared capacity, everyone you add to it needs a Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) license. These users can all collaborate on the dashboards and reports in the workspace. To distribute content to others inside your organization, either assign Power BI Pro licenses to those users or place the workspace in a Power BI Premium capacity.

When the workspace is in a Power BI Premium capacity, users with the Viewer role can access the workspace even if they don't have a Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) license. However, if you assign these users a higher role like Admin, Member, or Contributor, they're prompted to start a Pro trial when they try to create an artifact in the workspace. If your admin enabled this feature, see [Users can try Microsoft Fabric paid features](/fabric/admin/service-admin-portal-help-support#users-can-try-microsoft-fabric-paid-features). If you want users without Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) licenses to use the Viewer role, make sure they don't also have other workspace roles, either as individuals or as part of a user group.

Publishing reports to the workspace enforces existing licensing rules. If you try to publish from Power BI Desktop or other client tools without a Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) license, you see the error, "Only users with Power BI Pro licenses can publish to this workspace."

> [!NOTE]
> Power BI US Government isn't available as a Free license. For licensing details, see [Power BI for US government customers](../enterprise/service-govus-overview.md).

### Guest users

[Microsoft Entra B2B Guest users](/fabric/enterprise/powerbi/service-admin-entra-b2b) who are assigned a workspace role or granted specific item permissions can perform the operations permitted by those roles or permissions.

> [!NOTE]
> Guest users who are assigned workspace roles or specific item permissions keep those roles and permissions, even if the **[Allow Microsoft Entra guest users to edit and manage content in the organization](/fabric/admin/service-admin-portal-export-sharing#allow-azure-active-directory-guest-users-to-edit-and-manage-content-in-the-organization)** tenant setting is disabled.

## Considerations and limitations

Be aware of this limitation:

- A person with a Power BI Pro license can be a member of a maximum of 1,000 workspaces.
