# Save a Power BI paginated report to a local folder  with Power Automate

With [Power Automate](/power-automate/getting-started), you can automate exporting and distributing Power BI paginated reports to a variety of supported formats and scenarios. In this article, you use a template to set up recurring exports of a paginated report to your file system, in a desired format. See the Prerequisites if it's your first time using the Export to File for Paginated Reports action in a Power Automate flow.

5. In the **Workspace** box, select a workspace in a reserved capacity where the report is. In the **Report** box, select the paginated report that you wish to export in the workspace. In the **Export Format** box, select the desired export format. Optionally, you can specify parameters for the paginated report. See detailed descriptions of the parameters in the [connector reference for the Power BI REST API](/connectors/powerbi/#export-to-file-for-paginated-reports).

7. Power Automate automatically generates a **File name** and **File content** for you. You can modify the **File name**, but keep the dynamically generated **File content** value.
8. When you're done, select **Next step** or **Save**. Power Automate creates and evaluates the flow.
9. If Power Automate finds errors, select **Edit flow** to fix them. Otherwise, select the Back arrow to view the flow details and run the new flow.
10. When you run the flow, Power Automate exports a paginated report in the specified format to the selected folder in your file system.
