# Give users access to workspaces in Power BI

After you [create a workspace](service-create-the-new-workspaces.md) in Power BI, or if you have an admin role in a workspace, you can give others access to it by adding them to the different roles. Workspace creators are automatically admins. For an explanation of the different roles, see [Roles in workspaces](service-roles-new-workspaces.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must have the **Admin** role in a workspace to manage access and add users. If you don't see the **Manage access** button, verify that you have the Admin role for the workspace. Only workspace admins can add or remove users and manage permissions.

> [!NOTE]
> To enforce row-level security (RLS) for Power BI Pro users who browse content in a workspace, assign them the Viewer Role.
>
> After you add or remove a user or a group for workspace access, the permission change only takes effect the next time the user logs into Power BI.

## Give access to your workspace

1. Because you have the Admin role in the workspace, on the workspace content list page, you see **Manage access**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you don't see the **Manage access** button, you can access user management through **Workspace settings** (the gear icon or ellipsis menu) and then select **Manage access** or **Access** from the settings pane.

1. Select **Manage access** and then select **+ Add people or groups**.

1. On the **Add people** screen, you can add security groups, distribution lists, Microsoft 365 groups, or individuals to these workspaces as admins, members, contributors, or viewers.
