# Troubleshoot issues sharing dashboards and reports

Here are some common issues that might come up when you share a dashboard or report, or when someone else shares with you. 

## Dashboard recipients see a lock icon in a tile

The people you share with might see a locked tile in a dashboard, or a "Permission required" message when they try to view a report.

If so, you need to grant them permission to the underlying dataset.

1. Go to the **All** or the **Datasets + dataflows** tab in your content list.

1. Select **More options (...)** next to a dataset, then choose **Manage permissions**.

1. Select **Add user**.

1. Enter the full email addresses for individuals, distribution groups, or security groups that you want to add. You can't share dashboards or reports with dynamic distribution lists. Decide if the users can **share this dataset** or **build content with the data associated with this dataset**, and if you want to **send an email notification**.

1. Select **Grant access**.

## I can't share a dashboard or report

To share a dashboard or report, you need permission to reshare the underlying content; that is, any related reports and datasets. If you see a message saying you can't share, ask the report author to give you reshare permission for those reports and datasets.

## I don't have access to a dashboard or report

If you see a "Request access" message when you select the link to a report or dashboard, you don't have permission to view it. You need to [request access to it](service-request-access.md).
