# Troubleshoot sharing dashboards and reports

Here are some common issues that may come up when you're sharing a dashboard or report, or when someone else is sharing with you. 

## Dashboard recipients see a lock icon in a tile

The people you share with may see a locked tile in a dashboard, or a "Permission required" message when they try to view a report.

If so, you need to grant them permission to the underlying dataset.

1. Go to the **Datasets** tab in your content list.

1. Select the ellipsis (**...**) next to the dataset, then select **Manage permissions**.

1. Select **Add user**.

1. Enter the full email addresses for individuals, distribution groups, or security groups. You can't share with dynamic distribution lists.

1. Select **Add**.

## I can't share a dashboard or report

To share a dashboard or report, you need permission to reshare the underlying content; that is, any related reports and datasets. If you see a message saying you can't share, ask the report author to give you reshare permission for those reports and datasets.

## I don't have access to a dashboard or report

If you see a "Request access" message when you select the link to a report or dashboard, you don't have permission to view it. You need to [request access to it](service-request-access.md).
