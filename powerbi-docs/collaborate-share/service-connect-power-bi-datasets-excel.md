# Connect Excel to Power BI semantic models

Microsoft Excel is arguably the most common data analysis tool for information workers and organizations across the globe. Part of Excel’s appeal is that you can start your data journey in a few clicks, with quick calculations, data visualizations, and ad-hoc analysis.

You can discover, connect to, and explore centralized Power BI data inside the spreadsheet grid of Microsoft Excel. The versatility of Excel and the unified governance and security standards of Power BI ensures you're using the right data to make better decisions that support business goals and fosters an enhanced data culture.

When you access Power BI semantic models in Excel, the semantic models inherit properties. Inherited properties, like endorsement labels and sensitivity labels from Microsoft Purview Information Protection, help make sure that the data stays secure. Semantic models tagged with the labels Certified or Promoted are likely to be better quality and more authoritative than semantic models without a label.
