# Feature content on colleagues' Power BI Home page

You can feature dashboards, reports, and apps so they appear in the Featured section of your colleagues' Power BI Home page. Featuring content is especially useful for onboarding new employees to Power BI. You can decide which content they see first. You can add descriptions and small thumbnail images to help users find what they need. The content has to be in one of the new workspace experiences.

## Who can feature content

It's up to your Power BI admin to enable the ability to feature content on your tenant. The admin also chooses who can feature content. See the [admin portal](../admin/service-admin-portal.md#featured-content) article for details.

If you're one of the select group in your organization with that responsibility, you need to have a Power BI Pro license. To feature dashboards and reports, you need the Admin, Member, or Contributor role in the workspace. To feature the app itself, you need to have the Admin or Member role in the workspace. See [Roles in the new workspaces](service-new-workspaces.md#roles-in-the-new-workspaces) for details.

## Who sees featured content

If you feature a dashboard or report from a workspace, then the people who have at least a Viewer role in that workspace will see it featured. If you feature a dashboard or report from an app, or the app itself, then the people you distribute the app to will see it featured.

## Feature a dashboard or report

The procedure for featuring either a dashboard or report is similar.

1. In either the **Dashboards** or **Reports** list for a workspace, select the **Settings** icon.

2. In the **Settings** pane, check or change the name. Add a **Description** and upload a **Snapshot**, if you want them. They're useful because they help your users find your content.

3. Select **Featured**.

4. Select **Save**.

    Now all users who have access to this dashboard or report will see it in the **Featured** section on **Home**.

## Feature an app

- To feature an app, open the workspace for the app, select the **Options** menu (**...**) > **Feature this app on Home**.

Now everyone who has access to this app will also see it in the **Featured** section on **Home**.
