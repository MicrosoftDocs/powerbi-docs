# Create data point annotations

Data point annotations help users to make their presentations even more effective by enable them to add descriptive text directly to visuals, offering contextual explanations or highlights that improve communication and understanding of the data being presented. Annotations enable users to communicate insights clearly.

## Where do annotations show up?

These annotations aren’t presented when you view the same visual in the Power BI service or in any other place; the annotations are at your aid only in the context of the presentation they were created at. It also means that you can have multiple sets of annotations for the same visual when it appears in different instances of the add-in in the same or different presentations. Each set of annotations provides content that is truly in the context of the slide and presentation you are building.

* Each time you (or others) view this visualization in this slide, the annotations will be loaded as well.
* Annotations are displayed whenever the data point is visible. If the visual is filtered in such a way that results in the disappearance of the data point, the annotation likewise disappears.
* If the data updates and the data point no longer appears in the visual, the annotation will not appear either.
	
## Annotation in presentation mode
You can’t add new annotations while in presentation mode.
In presentation mode, you can manage the visibility of annotations. 
When and where do the annotations show up? To change the visibility of annotations, chose the Show/Hide Annotation option in the Data actions menu in the footer. (a keyboard shortcut makes it possible to show/hide the footer during a presentation mode. If annotations exist in the visual, but are currently hidden, a badge notification indicate to you that there are hidden annotations that you can reveal.  
  
## Considerations and limitations

* Annotations are not supported in custom visuals.
* Annotations are supported in all Power BI native Cartesians visuals, and in Pie and Donut charts.
* Annotations are available only when embedding a single visual, and not whole report page.
