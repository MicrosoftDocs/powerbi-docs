# Share a Power BI dashboard that links to an Excel file in OneDrive

In Power BI, you can [connect to Excel workbooks on OneDrive for work or school](../connect-data/service-excel-workbook-files.md) and pin tiles to a dashboard from that workbook. When you share that dashboard, selecting the tile opens the workbook inside Power BI. The workbook only opens if your colleagues have at least [read permissions](https://support.office.com/article/Share-documents-or-folders-in-Office-365-1fe37332-0f9a-4719-970e-d2578da4941c) to the workbook on OneDrive for work or school.

## Share a dashboard that contains workbook tiles
To share a dashboard that links back to an Excel workbook on OneDrive for work or school, see [Share a dashboard](service-share-dashboards.md). The difference is that you can modify the permissions for the linked Excel workbook before sharing.

1. Enter the email addresses for your colleagues you want to share the workbook with.
2. To enable your colleagues to view the Excel workbook from Power BI, select **Go to OneDrive for work or school to set workbook permissions**.
3. In OneDrive, [modify the permissions](https://support.office.com/article/Share-files-and-folders-and-change-permissions-9fcc2f7d-de0c-4cec-93b0-a82024800c07) as needed.
4. Select **Share**.

>[!NOTE]
>Your colleagues won't be able to pin additional tiles from that workbook or make changes to the Excel workbook from Power BI.

## Share a dashboard from a Power BI workspace

Sharing a dashboard from a Power BI workspace is similar to sharing a dashboard from your own workspace, except that the files are in a Microsoft 365 workspace site instead of your private OneDrive. Modify the permissions for the Excel workbook before you share the dashboard with people outside the workspace.
