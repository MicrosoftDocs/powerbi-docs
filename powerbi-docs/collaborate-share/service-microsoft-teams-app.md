# Add the Power BI app to Microsoft Teams

As a distributed and remote workforce becomes the norm, more organizations are relying on Microsoft Teams to keep employees connected. This article describes installing and interacting with the Power BI app in Microsoft Teams. The Power BI app brings your entire basic Power BI service experience into Microsoft Teams.

With the Power BI app in Microsoft Teams, you interact with all of your Power BI content, right in Microsoft Teams. It's as if the Power BI service lived inside Microsoft Teams. This app is your personal experience of Power BI. After you install it, you can do almost everything in Microsoft Teams that you can do in the Power BI service:

- Create, view, and edit dashboards, reports, and apps.
- Create and participate in workspaces.
- Share content, either through email or through Microsoft Teams.

There are a few features that you can only access in the Power BI service in a browser. See the [Known issues and limitations](#known-issues-and-limitations) section of this article for details.

## Requirements

In general, for Power BI to work in Microsoft Teams, ensure these elements:

- You have a Power BI Pro license.
- You have signed in to the Power BI service to activate your Power BI license.

## Install the Power BI app

Select **More added apps (...)** in the left navigation bar, then select **Power BI**. If you don't see it, type **Power BI** in the **Find an app** box.

That's it! The Power BI app is installed in Microsoft Teams.

## Interact with your content in Microsoft Teams

Interacting with your content in Microsoft Teams is the same as in the Power BI service. You interact with your dashboards, reports, apps, or workspaces in the same ways. 

You can even share a report to your coworkers in Microsoft Teams, from the Power BI app in Microsoft Teams.

### Differences in interactions

A few interactions are different in the Teams app than they are in the browser

- When you're looking at a dashboard or report, you don't see the Power BI navigation pane. Select the **Close** button to go back to Home or the workspace.

- You can choose to open the report in the Power BI service instead of viewing it in Microsoft Teams. Select **Open this on the web**.

## Known issues and limitations

- Some options in the Power BI service aren't available in Microsoft Teams. These options include:
    - Notifications.
    - Downloading apps such as Power BI Desktop and Power BI Paginated Report Builder.
    - Sending feedback.
    - Settings such as managing personal storage and accessing the admin portal.
- Power BI doesn't support the same localized languages that Microsoft Teams does. As a result, you might not see proper localization within a report.
