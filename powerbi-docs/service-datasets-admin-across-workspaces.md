# Control the use of datasets across workspaces (Preview)

Using datasets across workspaces is a powerful way to drive data culture and data democratization within an organization. Still, if you're a Power BI admin, sometimes you want to restrict the flow of information within your Power BI tenant. With the tenant setting **Use datasets across workspaces**, you can restrict dataset reuse either completely or partially per security groups.

If you turn off this setting, here are the effects on report creators:

- The button to copy reports across workspaces isn't available. 
- In a report based on a shared dataset, the **Edit report** button isn't available.
- In the Power BI service, the discovery experience only shows datasets in the current workspace.
- In Power BI Desktop, the discovery experience only shows datasets from workspaces where you're a member.
- In Power BI Desktop, if users open a .pbix file with a live connection to a dataset outside any workspaces they are a member of, they see an error message asking them to connect to a different dataset.

## Provide a link for the certification process

As a tenant admin, you can provide a URL for the **Learn more** link on the **Endorsement** setting page.  This link can go to documentation about your certification process. If you don't provide a destination for the **Learn more** link, by default it points to the [dataset certification](service-datasets-certify.md) article.
