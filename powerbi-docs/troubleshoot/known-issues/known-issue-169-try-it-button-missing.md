# Known issue - Try it button missing on REST API pages

**APPLIES TO:** ✔️ Power BI REST APIs

**Status:** Open

**Problem area:** Embedded, REST API or PowerShell

## Description of problem

In the past, you were able to try Power BI REST APIs on each operation referenced in the [Power BI REST API reference](/rest/api/power-bi).   Under **Examples**, you would see **Sample Request** code sections with a "Try it" button on the header to test the API.

The "Try it" button is currently missing on all REST API pages.

## Symptoms

On each operation page, there will be no "Try it" button.

## Solutions and workarounds

The Power BI team is aware of the issue and is working on a fix.  In the meantime, you can test the API by using an external API testing tool.
