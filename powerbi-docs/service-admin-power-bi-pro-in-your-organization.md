# Power BI Pro in your organization

Power BI Pro is a paid licenses that enables more features. Power BI Pro licenses are for a team that wants to share and collaborate with others to make data-driven decisions.  Each team member creating or viewing shared Power BI content needs a Pro license unless the content is associated with a dedicated capacity using Power BI Premium.

These features require a Power BI Pro license:

* **View shared content** - Pro users can view dashboards and reports that are shared with them, interact with dashbaords and reports that are shareed with them, and re-share dashboards and reports that are shaed with them (if allowed).
