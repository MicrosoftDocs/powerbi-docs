To get the client ID GUID (also know as *application ID*), follow these steps:

1. Log into [Microsoft Azure](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#allservices).

2. Search for **App registrations** and select the **App registrations** link.

3. Select the Microsoft Entra app you're using for embedding your Power BI content.

4. From the **Overview** section, copy the **Application (client) ID** GUID.
