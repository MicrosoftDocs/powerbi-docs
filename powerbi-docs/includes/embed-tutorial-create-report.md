Your next step is to create a report and upload it to your workspace. You can [create your own report](../fundamentals/desktop-getting-started.md#build-reports) using Power BI Desktop, and then [publish](../fundamentals/desktop-getting-started.md#share-your-work) it to your workspace. Or, you can upload a sample report to your workspace.

If you want to embed a report using Direct Lake mode, make sure your semantic model is [Direct Lake enabled](/fabric/get-started/direct-lake-power-bi-desktop) with a [fixed identity](/fabric/get-started/direct-lake-fixed-identity).

>[!Tip]
>If you already have a workspace with a report, you can skip this step.

To download a sample report (not Direct Lake enabled) and publish it to your workspace, follow these steps:

1. Open the GitHub [Power BI Desktop samples](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerBI-Desktop-Samples) folder.

1. Select **Code** and then select **Download zip**.
