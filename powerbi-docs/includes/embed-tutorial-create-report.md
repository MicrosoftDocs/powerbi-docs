Your next step is to create a report and upload it to your workspace. You can [create your own report](../create-reports/desktop-excel-stunning-report.md) by using Power BI Desktop, and then [publish](../create-reports/desktop-excel-stunning-report.md#publish-your-report) it to your workspace. Or, you can upload a sample report to your workspace.

> [!TIP]
> If you already have a workspace with a report, you can skip this step.

To download a sample report (not Direct Lake-enabled) and publish it to your workspace, follow these steps:

1. Open the GitHub [Power BI Desktop samples](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerBI-Desktop-Samples) folder.
1. Select **Code** and then select **Download ZIP**.
