By default, your metadata will not be available in regions other than where Power BI is based. However, you can decide to let Power BI share metadata across regions. By enabling the setting *Display Power BI metadata even if your Power BI tenant and M365 are in different geographical regions*, the Power BI administrator explicitly opts in to this feature, and acknowledges enabling these cross-service capabilities may result in Power BI metadata flowing outside the geographic region it's stored in.
