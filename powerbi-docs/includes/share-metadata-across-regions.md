By default, your metadata will not be available in regions other than where Power BI is based. However, you can decide to let Power BI share metadata across regions. By enabling the setting *Users can see Power BI metadata in Microsoft 365 services even if the tenants are located in different geographical regions*, the Power BI administrator explicitly opts in to this feature, and acknowledges enabling these cross-service capabilities may result in Power BI metadata flowing outside the geographic region it's stored in.
