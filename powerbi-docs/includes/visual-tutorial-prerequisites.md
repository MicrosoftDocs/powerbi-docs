Before you start developing your Power BI visual, verify that you have everything listed in this section.

* A **Power BI Pro** or **Premium Per User (PPU)** account. If you don't have one, [sign up for a free trial](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/pricing/).

* [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://www.visualstudio.com/). VS Code is an ideal Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for developing JavaScript and TypeScript applications.

* [Windows PowerShell](/powershell/scripting/install/installing-windows-powershell) version 4 or later (for Windows). Or [Terminal](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/mac) (for Mac).

* An environment ready for developing a Power BI visual. [Set up your environment for developing a Power BI visual](../developer/visuals/environment-setup.md).

* This tutorial uses the **US Sales Analysis** report. You can [download this report](https://microsoft.github.io/PowerBI-visuals/docs/step-by-step-lab/images/US_Sales_Analysis.pbix) and upload it to Power BI service, or use your own report. If you need more information about Power BI service, and uploading files, refer to the [Get started creating in the Power BI service](../fundamentals/service-get-started.md) tutorial.
