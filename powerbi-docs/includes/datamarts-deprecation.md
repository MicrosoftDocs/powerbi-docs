> [!IMPORTANT]
> Since November 1, 2025, Power BI datamarts are no longer supported, and datamarts are not accessible from workspaces. To avoid losing your data and breaking reports built on top of datamarts, migrate your datamart to warehouse. **To learn more, see [Upgrade a Power BI Datamart to a Warehouse](/fabric/data-warehouse/datamart-upgrade-to-warehouse).**
