> The Power BI datamarts feature is being retired in October 2025. To avoid losing your data and breaking reports built on top of datamarts, you should [upgrade your Power BI Datamart to a Warehouse](/fabric/data-warehouse/datamart-upgrade-to-warehouse). For more information, see [Unify Datamart with Fabric Data Warehouse](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/unify-datamart-with-fabric-data-warehouse/).
