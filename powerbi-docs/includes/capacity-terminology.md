> [!NOTE]
> Capacity terminology: Fabric F SKUs (and time‑limited FT trial capacities) are the current purchase path. Power BI Premium (P SKUs) remains supported for existing customers. Pro and Premium Per User (PPU) are per‑user licenses; PPU unlocks most capacity features without assigning a dedicated capacity. Free users can only view content stored in a workspace on a capacity (Fabric F64+ or Premium P).
