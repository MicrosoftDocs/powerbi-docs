**Self-service sign-up is disabled**
You attempt to sign up and receive a message similar to this:

*We can't finish signing you up. Your IT department has turned off signup for Microsoft Power BI. Contact them to complete signup.*

**Solution**
Self-service sign-up for Power BI has been disabled. To finish signing up, contact your IT department or help desk and ask them to [follow these instructions to assign you a license](../enterprise/service-admin-purchasing-power-bi-pro.md).

You might also experience this problem if you signed up for Microsoft 365 through a partner. In which case, contact the organization responsible for providing you with Microsoft 365.
