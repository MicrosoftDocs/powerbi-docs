Microsoft Fabric keeps your reports, dashboards, and tiles in a workspace. To embed these items, you need to create them and upload them into a workspace. You can also embed items using [Direct Lake](/fabric/get-started/direct-lake-overview) mode, which allows you to connect directly to your data lake without having to import its data (preview).

>[!TIP]
>If you already have a workspace, you can skip this step.

To create a workspace, do the following:

1. Sign in to Fabric.

2. Select **Workspaces**.

3. Select **+ New workspace**.

4. Name your workspace and select **Save**.
