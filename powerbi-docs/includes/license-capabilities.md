In the Power BI service, users have defined capabilities based on two types of licenses:

* **Per-user** - *Power BI Pro licensing and free licensing*. A Power BI Pro license enables access to all content and capabilities in the Power BI service, including the ability to share content and collaborate with other Pro users. Only Pro users can publish to and consume content from app workspaces, share dashboards, and subscribe to dashboards and reports. A free license enables access to some of the features of the Power BI service. For more information, see [Per-user license type comparison](../service-features-license-type.md#per-user-license-type-comparison).

* **Capacity-based** - *Power BI Premium licensing*. Premium provides dedicated capacity to deliver more consistent performance and support larger data volumes in Power BI. For individual users, Premium also enables widespread distribution of content by Pro users without requiring Pro licenses for recipients who view the content. For more information, see [What is Power BI Premium?](../service-premium.md).
