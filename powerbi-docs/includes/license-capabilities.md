In the Power BI service, users have defined capabilities based on the type of per-user license they have and whether the content they are acting on is in a workspace assigned to a Power BI Premium capacity.

* **Per-user** - *Power BI Pro and Fabric (free) licenses*. A Power BI Pro license enables a user to collaborate with other Power BI Pro users by consuming content from, and sharing content with other users with a Power BI Pro license. Only users with a Power BI Pro license can publish content to app workspaces, share dashboards, and subscribe to dashboards and reports. A free license enables a user to consume content in a workspace assigned to a Power BI Premium capacity or Fabric F64 or greater capacity and access to some of the features of the Power BI service for their own personal content in their My Workspace. For more information, see [Sign up for Power BI as an individual](../fundamentals/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi.md) and [Purchase and assign Power BI Pro user licenses](/power-bi/enterprise/service-admin-purchasing-power-bi-pro).

* **Power BI Premium capacity** - *Power BI Premium licensing*. Power BI Premium provides a capacity to deliver more consistent performance and support larger data volumes in Power BI. Power BI Premium also enables widespread distribution of content by Pro users without requiring users who view the content to have Power BI Pro licenses. For more information, see [What is Power BI Premium?](/power-bi/enterprise/service-premium-what-is)
