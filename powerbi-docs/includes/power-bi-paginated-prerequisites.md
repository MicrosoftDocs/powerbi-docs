- You don't need any license to [download Power BI Report Builder](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2086513) from the Microsoft Download Center for free.
- You can publish and share paginated reports in your My Workspace or in other workspaces, as long as you have write access to the workspace. 
- In a Premium Gen1 capacity, a Power BI admin needs to enable paginated reports in the [Premium capacities section](../enterprise/service-admin-premium-workloads.md#paginated-reports) of the Power BI admin portal. In a [Premium Gen2 capacity](../enterprise/service-premium-gen2-what-is.md#paginated-reports), paginated reports are enabled automatically.
