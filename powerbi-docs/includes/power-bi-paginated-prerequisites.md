License requirements for Power BI paginated reports (.rdl files) are the same as for [Power BI reports](../fundamentals/service-features-license-type.md) (.pbix files).

- You don't need a license to [download Power BI Report Builder](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2086513) from the Microsoft Download Center for free.
- With a free license, you can publish paginated reports to My Workspace in the Power BI service. For more information, see [Feature availability for users with free licenses in the Power BI service](../consumer/end-user-features.md#licenses).
- With a Power BI Pro license or a PPU license, you can publish paginated reports to other workspaces. You also need at least a [contributor role](../collaborate-share/service-roles-new-workspaces.md#workspace-roles) in the workspace.
- You need [Build permission for the dataset](../connect-data/service-datasets-build-permissions.md).
