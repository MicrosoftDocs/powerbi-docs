License requirements for Power BI paginated reports (.rdl files) are the same as for [Power BI reports](../fundamentals/service-features-license-type.md) (.pbix files).

- With a free license, you can publish paginated reports to My Workspace in the Power BI service. For more information, see [Feature availability for users with free licenses in the Power BI service](../consumer/end-user-features.md#licenses).
- With a Power BI Pro license or a PPU license, you can publish paginated reports to other workspaces. You also need at least a [contributor role](../collaborate-share/service-roles-new-workspaces.md#workspace-roles) in the workspace.
- You don't need [Power BI Report Builder](../paginated-reports/report-builder-power-bi.md) to create a paginated report in the Power BI service.
