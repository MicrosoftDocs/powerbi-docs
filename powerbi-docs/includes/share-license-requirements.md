> To share content (or for a colleague without edit rights to view content outside your personal **My workspace**) both users need either a Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) license, **OR** the content must reside in a workspace on a capacity (Fabric F64+ or Power BI Premium (P)). PPU workspaces behave like capacity for feature availability. Free users can only consume content that lives on a capacity.
