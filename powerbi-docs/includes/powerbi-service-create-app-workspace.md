1. Start by creating the workspace. Select **Workspaces** > **Create app workspace**. **Revert to classic** 
   
     ![Create app workspace](media/powerbi-service-create-app-workspace/power-bi-create-app-workspace.png)
   
    This will be the place to put content that you and your colleagues collaborate on.

2. Give the workspace a name. If the corresponding **Workspace ID** isn't available, edit it to come up with a unique ID.
   
     This will be the name of the app, too.

3. You have a few options to set. If you choose **Public**, anyone in your organization can see what’s in the workspace. **Private**, on the other hand, means only members of the workspace can see its contents.

    You can't change the Public/Private setting after you've created the group.

4. You can also choose if members can **edit** or have **view-only** access.
   
     ![Set edit or view-only](media/powerbi-service-create-app-workspace/power-bi-apps-create-workspace-members-edit.png)
   
     Only add people to the app workspace so they can edit the content. If they're only going to view the content, don't add them to the workspace. You can include them when you publish the app.

5. Add email addresses of people you want to have access to the workspace, and select **Add**. You can’t add group aliases, just individuals.

6. Decide whether each person is a member or an admin.
   
     ![Set Member or Admin](media/powerbi-service-create-app-workspace/power-bi-apps-create-workspace-admin.png)
   
    Admins can edit the workspace itself, including adding other members. Members can edit the content in the workspace, unless they have view-only access. Both admins and members can publish the app.

7. Select **Save**.

Power BI creates the workspace and opens it. It appears in the list of workspaces you’re a member of. Because you’re an admin, you can select the ellipsis (…) to go back and make changes to it, adding new members or changing their permissions.
