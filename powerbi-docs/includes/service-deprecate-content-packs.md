>We'll be deprecating this content pack on September 25, 2019. If you installed this content pack before then, it will continue to work, but you won't be able to install a new one after that. [Template apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/service-template-apps-overview) are the replacement for service content packs.
