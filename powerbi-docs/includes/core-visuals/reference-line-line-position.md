###### Position

With this dropdown menu, users have several options to define the position of the reference line:
- **Behind:** Positions the reference line behind the data bars to maintain focus on the data itself, while still providing a point of reference. This prevents the reference line from overpowering the visualization when dealing with complex charts where too many  foreground elements can make the chart difficult to read.
- **In front:** Positions the reference line in front of the data bars to make it more visible and prominent, which can be beneficial to highlight specific thresholds or targets critical to analysis. This setting can helps to see how the data compares to the reference line without any visual obstruction.
