#### Layout

The Layout menu offers three options for customizing the presentation of your data:
**- Compact:** The default space-saving layout where row labels are displayed in a single column, and the hierarchy is represented through indentation, useful for displaying more data in less space.
**- Outline:** Separates each level of the hierarchy into its own column, similar to the way a traditional pivot table displays data, making it easier to read and understand the hierarchy at a glance.
**- Tabular:** Similar to the outline layout but without indentation. Each hierarchy level is still in its own column, but the data is presented in a flat structure.
