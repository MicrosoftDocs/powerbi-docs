###### Style

The menu provides options for configuring the axis title, but only when the axis value's Display units is set to display Thousands, Millions, Billions, or Trillions:
**- Shows title only:** This default option displays only the title. If the Display units are set to *None*, this remains the only available option.
**- Show unit only:** This exhibits solely the unit as determined in the display units control.
**- Show both:** This presents both the title and the unit as selected in the Display units control.
