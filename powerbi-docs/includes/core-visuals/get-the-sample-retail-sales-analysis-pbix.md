As with many documents throughout our Visualizations documentation, in the following guide we’re using the [Retail Analysis Sample PBIX file](https://download.microsoft.com/download/9/6/D/96DDC2FF-2568-491D-AAFA-AFDD6F763AE3/Retail%20Analysis%20Sample%20PBIX.pbix), and we always start with a new page before proceeding. After downloading the file to your desktop, open the file and select the + icon to add a new page to the report. From here, we’ll create a new visual by selecting the appropriate data fields and visual elements.
