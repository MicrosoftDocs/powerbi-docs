#### Match value alignment

When enabled, and the **Apply settings to** has been set to **Series all**, this toggle ensures that the horizontal alignment of all labels match the alignment of the data values. When the toggle is *not* enabled, the horizontal alignment options are available, allowing you to align the text to the left, center, or right according to your liking.
