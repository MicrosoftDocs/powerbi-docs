##### Match value alignment

When enabled, and the **Apply settings to** is set to **Series all**, this toggle ensures that the horizontal alignment of all labels matches the alignment of the data values. When the toggle *isn't* enabled, the horizontal alignment options are available, allowing you to align the text to your liking.
