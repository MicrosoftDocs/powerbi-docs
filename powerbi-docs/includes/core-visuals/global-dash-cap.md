##### Dash cap

This dropdown menu determines the line's end style, offering options such as:

**- Flat:** This cap style creates a flat end to each dash, making the ends of the dashed line look squared off and abrupt.
**- Round:** This cap style adds a semi-circular, rounded end to each dash, giving the dashed line a softer and more continuous appearance.
**- Square:** Similar to the flat cap, but with a more pronounced square shape that extends beyond the width of the line, making the dashes look like they have small squares at the ends.
