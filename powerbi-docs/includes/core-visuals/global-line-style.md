##### Line style

The menu provides four selections to customize the line style pattern:
- **Solid:** A continuous line without breaks.
- **Dashed:** A line consisting of a series of short segments. The dashed pattern can scale with the line width.
- **Dotted:** A line made up of a sequence of dots. The dotted pattern can scale with the line width.
- **Custom:** This option introduces a dash array control, allowing for a user-defined pattern syntax (dash, gap, etc.). The custom pattern can scale with the line width, and you can select a dash cap style from flat, round, or square options. Keep in mind, the dash cap feature can greatly change the appearance of the line style specified in the dash array.
