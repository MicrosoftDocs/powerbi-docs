##### Dash array

The Dash array text input field enables the creation of custom line patterns. Enter a sequence of numbers to define the dash and gap lengths in pixels, using the syntax: dash length, gap length.

   **Example:**
   '2 5 2 5' represents a pattern with a 2-pixel dash, a 5-pixel gap, followed by another 2-pixel dash and a 5-pixel gap.
