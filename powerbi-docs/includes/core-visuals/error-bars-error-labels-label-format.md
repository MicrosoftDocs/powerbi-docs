##### Label format

The format setting provides four options:
- **Absolute:** This displays the actual numeric deviation from the reported value, providing insight into how much each data point might differ from its true value.
- **Relative (numeric):** This displays a numeric deviation as a proportion or ratio relative to a reference point, helping to understand the significance of variations.
- **Relative (percentage):** This displays a percentage relative error that focuses on the percentage deviation from a reference point.
- **Range:** This indicates the span between the upper and lower bounds of a data point, representing the potential variability.
