##### Vertical position

With this dropdown menu, users have two options to specify the vertical position of the reference line data label:
- **Above:** Positions the label above the reference line, which can be useful when you want to avoid overlapping with the data points.
- **Under:** Positions the label below the reference line, which can help in distinguishing it from other chart elements.
