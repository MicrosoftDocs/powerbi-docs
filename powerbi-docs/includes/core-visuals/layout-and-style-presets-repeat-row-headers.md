###### Repeat row headers

This toggle controls whether the row headers are repeated on each page of a paginated report. When enabled, the row headers will appear at the top of each page, which can be particularly useful when you have a matrix that spans multiple pages, ensuring that the context of the data is not lost when moving between pages.
