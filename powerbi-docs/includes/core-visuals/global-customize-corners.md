##### Customize corners

The **Customize corners** toggle lets you adjust the curvature of each individual corner of your visual. When this toggle is enabled, you can specify different radius values for the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right corners, providing even greater flexibility in designing unique and visually appealing shapes that align with your report's overall design.
