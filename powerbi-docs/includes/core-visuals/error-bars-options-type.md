#### Type

Select from the following:

**- By field:** Specify the value of another field to determine the upper and lower bounds for each error bar, allowing you to customize error bars based on specific criteria.
**- By percentage:** Extend above and below the column or shape they pertain to by a specified percentage of the value represented by the column or shape.
**- By percentile:** Calculate bounds based on aggregated data points at each X-axis value on your chart. Results can be unexpected, so it’s essential to understand the statistical implications.
**- By standard deviation:** Most common statistical treatment for error bars, representing the variability around each data point based on the standard deviation of the underlying data.
