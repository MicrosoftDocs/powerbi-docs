##### Customize lines

The **Customize lines** toggle, when enabled, displays two groups of the same controls. The first group of controls applies the format settings to the **Borders**, and the second group of controls applies the format settings to the  **Gridlines**. When toggled off, the format options are applied to both Borders and Gridlines together.
