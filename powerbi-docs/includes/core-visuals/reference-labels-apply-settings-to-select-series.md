#### Select series

With the **Apply setting to** menu, you can select which series to customize. When **All series** is selected, you can customize **Options**, **Title**, **Value**, **Detail**, **Divider**, **Background**, **Layout**, and **Spacing**. When selecting an *individual* series, only the **Title**, **Value**, **Detail**, **Divider**, and **Background** menus are available enabling you to customize formatting for each series individually.
