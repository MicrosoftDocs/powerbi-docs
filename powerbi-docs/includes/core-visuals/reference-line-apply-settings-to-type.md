##### Type

There are several types of reference lines that can be added to column charts to provide including:

- **Constant line:** A line that remains constant across the chart, which can be useful for marking a specific value such as a sales target or a historical benchmark.
- **X-Axis constant line:** A vertical line at a constant value along the primary axis, useful for marking a specific point in time or category.
- **Min line:** A line that represents the minimum value in your data set.
- **Max line:** A line that represents the maximum value in your data set.
- **Average line:** A line that represents the average value of the data points in your visual.
- **Median Line:** A line that represents the median value of the data points in your visual, providing a sense of the distributionâ€™s center.
- **Percentile Line:** A line that represents a specific percentile in your data set, allowing you to see how a particular value compares to the rest of the distribution.

The **Constant line** is available for *all* Column charts. The **X-Axis constant line** is also available for *all* Column charts, but *only* when the X-Axis is set to Continuous. The **Min**, **Max**, **Average**, **Median**, and **Percentile** lines are only available for Clustered column charts.
