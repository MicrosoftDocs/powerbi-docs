##### Format code

The **Format code** setting, available only when selecting custom display units, allows you to customize the display format of values using custom format codes (based on Excel format codes) or apply conditional formatting. Format codes change how numbers, dates, and other data types are presented, such as formatting numbers as currency with **$#,###M** or dates as **yyyy-MM-dd**, ensuring your data is presented in a manner tailored to the specific needs of your visual.
