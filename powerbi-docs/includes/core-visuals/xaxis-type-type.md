###### Type
This menu presents two distinct options for setting the axis type:
- **Continuous:** This option arranges data values along the axis as evenly spaced discrete entries, without considering the actual distance between individual data points.
- **Categorical:** Opting for this setting ensures that all data values are represented. The axis is automatically labeled with suitable time increments to reflect the data distribution accurately.
