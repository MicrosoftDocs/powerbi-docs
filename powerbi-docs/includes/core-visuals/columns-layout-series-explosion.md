##### Series explosion

This toggle is only visible when using stacked bar or column charts. Enabling this toggle adjusts the **Space between series** setting to increase series separation from 0% (*no space*) to 10%, calculated from the tallest column plotted. This feature is exclusive to stacked column or bars, and it removes the secondary axis.
