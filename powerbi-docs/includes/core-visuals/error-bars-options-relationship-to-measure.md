##### Relationship to measure

This refers to how the error bars are calculated relative to the primary measure. Here, there are two ways to define error bars:
- **Absolute:** Represents the exact value of the upper or lower bound, to emphasize precise ranges of uncertainty around data points..
- **Relative:** Represents the difference between the upper or lower bound and the measure itself, to focus on deviations from the measure, regardless of specific values.
