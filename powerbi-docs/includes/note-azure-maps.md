> [!NOTE]
> The Azure Maps visual is now generally available, except for in sovereign clouds. When you open a report with an existing map visual, if Azure Maps is enabled for your organization, you see a message encouraging you to upgrade your maps and filled maps to Azure Maps. In a future release, Power BI plans to deprecate older map visuals and migrate existing reports to Azure Maps. You can [convert maps and filled maps to Azure Maps visuals](/azure/azure-maps/power-bi-visual-conversion?context=/power-bi/create-reports/context/context) now. Note that this excludes sovereign clouds.
