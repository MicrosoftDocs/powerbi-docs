***Data classification***

* You can now tag your dashboards with classifications defined by your company's IT department, raising awareness of those viewing your dashboards about what level of security should be used.

***Analyze your on-premises data in Excel***

* Analyze in Excel feature has expanded to support on-premises datasets. We establish a secure and direct connection to your on-premises dataset that enables you to analyze it in Excel. We also introduced a setting for admins to turn off the Analyze in Excel feature for on-premises sources.

### May 2016
***Get Data***

We also added support for refreshing datasets that include data from SAP Business Warehouse Server using the gateway and creating UPN mapping rules when you are using Analysis Services with the gateway.

***Row-level security (RLS)***

* Azure Active Directory (AAD) group support: Users can now assign AAD groups (security groups and distribution lists) to a role. This makes it easier to assign roles to a large group of users at once.
* [Test your RLS roles with reports backed by the data with RLS in place](service-admin-rls.md#validating-the-role-within-power-bi-desktop): We added a feature to our RLS preview that lets you test your dataset as a specific role. This will make sure the role works as you expect before any users get their hands on your dashboard.
* Define and apply RLS to cloud models based on direct queries: You can now create and apply RLS rules for direct query data sources.

***Dashboards***

* Favorite dashboards: To help you reach the dashboards you go to most, we added a way to favorite those dashboard and make them easily accessible from all your workspaces.

Now as soon as you select Analyze in Excel for a data source we don't support, you'll see a message letting you know we don't yet support that data source.
