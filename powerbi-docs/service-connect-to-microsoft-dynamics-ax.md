## What's included
The content pack uses the Dynamics AX 7 OData feed to import data related to Retail Channel, Financial, and Cost Management performance respectively.

## System requirements
This content pack requires a Dynamics AX 7 environment URL and the user should have access to the OData feed.

## Finding parameters
<a name="FindingParams"></a>

The Dynamics AX 7 environment URL can be found in the browser when the user signs in. Just copy the URL of the root Dynamics AX environment into the Power BI dialog.

## Troubleshooting
The data may take some time to load depending on the size of your instance. If you're seeing empty reports within Power BI, please confirm you have access to the OData tables required for the reports.
