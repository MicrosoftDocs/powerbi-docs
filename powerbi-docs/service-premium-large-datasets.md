# Power BI Premium support for large datasets

Power BI Premium supports uploads of Power BI Desktop (.pbix) files that are up to 10 GB in size. Once uploaded, a dataset can be refreshed to up to 12 GB in size. To use a large dataset, publish it to a workspace that is assigned to Premium capacity. This article describes considerations and best practices for working with large datasets.

**Large models can be very resource-intensive** on your capacity. We recommend at least a P1 SKU for any models larger than 1 GB. The following table describes recommended SKUs for various .pbix sizes:

   |SKU  |Size of .pbix   |
   |---------|---------|
   |P1    | < 3 GB        |
   |P2    | < 6 GB        |
   |P3, P4, P5    | up to 10 GB |

**Your .pbix files represent data in a highly compressed state**. The data will likely expand several times when loaded in memory, and from there it may expand several more times during data refresh.

**Scheduled refresh of large datasets can take a long time** and be very resource-intensive. Accordingly, do not schedule too many overlapping refreshes. Notice also that the timeout for scheduled refresh jobs has been doubled to four hours for all datasets in this capacity. We recommend [incremental refresh](service-premium-incremental-refresh.md), because it's faster, more reliable, and consumes fewer resources.

**The initial report load of large datasets can take a long time** if it has been a while since the last time the dataset was used, because the model is loaded into memory of your Premium capacity. A loading bar for longer-loading reports displays the load progress.

**If you remove the workspace from Premium capacity**, the model and all associated reports and dashboards will not work.

**While the per-query memory and time constraints are much higher in Premium capacity**, it is highly recommended that you use filters and slicers to limit visuals to display only what is necessary.
