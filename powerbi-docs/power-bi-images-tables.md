# Display images in a table, matrix, or slicer in a report

A good way to enhance your reports is to add images to them. Static images on the page are good for some purposes. But sometimes you want images that relate to the data in your report. This topic teaches you how to display images in a table, matrix, slicer, or multi-row card.

## Add images to your report

1. Create a column with the URLs of the images. See [Considerations](#considerations) later in this article for requirements.

1. Select that column. On the **Modeling** ribbon, for **Data category**, select **Image URL**.

1. Add the column to a table, matrix, slicer, or multi-row card.

## Considerations

- The image needs to be in one of these file formats: .bmp, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .png, or  .svg
- The URL needs to be anonymously accessible, not on a site that requires a sign-in, such as SharePoint. However, if images are hosted on SharePoint or OneDrive, you may be able to get an embed code that points directly to them.
