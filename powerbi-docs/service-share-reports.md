# Filter and share a Power BI report
*Sharing* is a good way to give a few people access to your dashboards and reports. What if you want to share a filtered version of a report? Maybe you want the report to show only data for a specific city or salesperson or year. This article explains how to filter a report and share the filtered version of the report. Another way to share a filtered report is to [add query parameters to the report URL](service-url-filters.md). In both cases, the report is filtered when recipients first open it. They can clear the filter selections in the report.

Power BI also offers [other ways to collaborate and distribute your reports](service-how-to-collaborate-distribute-dashboards-reports.md). With sharing, you and your recipients need a [Power BI Pro license](service-features-license-type.md), or the content needs to be in a [Premium capacity](service-premium-what-is.md). 

## Follow along with sample data

This article uses the Marketing and Sales sample template app. Want to try it? 

1. Install the [Marketing and Sales sample template app](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/power-bi/microsoft-retail-analysis-sample.salesandmarketingsample?tab=Overview).
2. Select the app and select **Explore app**.

3. Select the pencil icon to open the workspace that you installed with the app.

4. In the workspace content list, select **Reports**, then select the report **Sales and Marketing Sample PBIX**.

    ![Open sample report](media/service-share-reports/power-bi-open-sample-report.png)

    Now you're ready to follow along.

## Set a filter in the report

Open a report in [Editing view](consumer/end-user-reading-view.md) and apply a filter.

In this example, we're filtering the YTD Category page of the Marketing and Sales sample template app to show only values where **Region** equals **Central**.

   ![Select Share](media/service-share-reports/power-bi-share.png)
