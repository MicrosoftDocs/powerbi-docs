# Service interruption notifications

It's crucial to have insight into the availability of your mission critical business applications. Power BI provides incident notification so you can optionally receive emails if there's a service disruption or degradation. While Power BIâ€™s 99.9% service level agreement (SLA) makes these occurrences rare, we want to ensure that you're kept informed. The following screenshot shows the type of email you'll receive if you enable notifications:

At this time, we send emails for the following _reliability scenarios_:

- Open report reliability
- Model refresh reliability
- Query refresh reliability

Notifications are sent when there is an _extended delay_ in operations like opening reports, dataset refresh, or query executions. After an incident is resolved, you receive a follow-up email.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is currently available only for dedicated capacities in Power BI Premium. It's not available for shared or embedded capacity.

## Enable notifications

A Power BI tenant administrator enables notifications in the admin portal:

1. Identify or create an email-enabled security group that should receive notifications.

1. In the admin portal, select **Tenant settings**. Under **Help and support settings**, expand **Receive email notifications for service outages or incidents**.

1. Enable notifications, enter a security group, and select **Apply**.

> [!NOTE]
> Power BI sends notifications from the account no-reply-powerbi@microsoft.com. Ensure that this account is whitelisted so that notifications don't end up in a spam or junk folder.
