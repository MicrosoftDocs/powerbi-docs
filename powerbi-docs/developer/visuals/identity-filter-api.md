# Identity filter API

The **Identity filter API** allows you to create a visual that can filter categorical data using a semantic query.  
It filters the data by **data points** rather than mathematical expressions.

The API keeps track of user selections and which data points to display. The data points are saved in an array and referenced by their position in the array.

This API is useful in the following scenarios:

* For custom visuals that use datasets with group on keys
* Migrating visuals that used an older API (earlier than 2.2) to a newer API
* Allow selections using identifying index arrays

> [!NOTE]
> The **Identity filter API** is available from API version 5.1 To find out which version you’re using, check the `apiVersion` in the *pbiviz.json* file.

The Identity filter model is based on the [IIdentityFilter](/javascript/api/powerbi/powerbi-models/iidentityfilter) interface.

```typescript
    private filter: IIdentityFilter = {
        $schema: “”,
        filterType: FilterType.Identity,
        operator: "In",
        target: []
    }
```

For example, if the visual received the following data view update:

:::image type="content" source="./media/identity-filter-api/target-array.png" alt-text="Screenshot of sample array.":::

Note that the array is of type number[] and it contains the identity fields of the items that the user selected.

The identityIndex corresponds to the index of the value in the dataset's value array (see below).

:::image type="content" source="./media/identity-filter-api/array-values.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing array values of names.":::

In the above example:
{identityIndex: 0} = "Aaliyah"
{identityIndex: 1} = "Aaliyah"
{identityIndex: 02 = "Aaliyah"
etc.

## How to use the Identity filter API

To use the Identity filter API, your powerbi-models version needs to be 1.9.1 or higher.

* Add the following property as a member of the visual.ts class.

  ```typescript
      private filter: IIdentityFilter = {
          $schema: “”,
          filterType: FilterType.Identity,
          operator: "In",
          target: []
      }
  ```

* To handle Power BI updates, read the *target* array from the “jsonFilters” in the “VisualUpdateOptions” and translate it to the corresponding values. These are the values that were selected. In the example above, a target array of [0,10] will correspond to the values of *Aliyah* and *Abigail*.

* To handle user selections, in the example above, clicking on the first *Abigail* should add the value 8 to the filter target array an send it using the following command:

```typescript
this.visualHost.applyJsonFilter(this.filter, "general", "filter", powerbi.FilterAction.merge);
```

## Sample JSON filter

Some sample JSON filter code is shown in the following

## Example: Identity filter API

The following example shows how the visual calls a filter operation.

## Migrating visuals with old API

Starting from API 5.1.0, to support the identity filter on visuals that were created using a version earlier than 2.2, add the following lines to your *capabilities.json* file:

```json
    "migration": {
        "filter": {
            "shouldUseIdentityFilter": true
        }
    }
```

This will convert the selections to identity filters.

> [!NOTE]
> This step is only necessary for existing visuals created with older APIs. Newer visuals don't need to add this.
