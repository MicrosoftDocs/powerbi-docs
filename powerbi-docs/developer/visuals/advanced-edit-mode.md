# Advanced edit mode in Power BI visuals

In *Advanced Edit* mode, you can use advanced UI controls in your Power BI visual. From the *Report Editing* mode, select the **Edit** button on a visual and choose the **Advanced** edit mode. The visual uses the `EditMode` flag to determine if the visual displays the **Edit** UI control.

By default, the visual doesn't support Advanced Edit mode (`"advancedEditModeSupport: 0"`). To enable Advanced Edit mode, add a line to the visual's *capabilities.json* file that sets the `advancedEditModeSupport` property.

The possible values are:

* `0` - **NotSupported**. The visual doesn't support Advanced Edit mode. The **Edit** button doesn't appear on this visual.

* `1` - **SupportedNoAction**. The visual supports Advanced Edit mode and doesn't require more changes. Power BI doesn't switch the visual to *Focus* Mode. Developers might use this setting as an external button to run several processes in the same viewport.

* `2` - **SupportedInFocus**. The visual supports Advanced Edit mode and requires the host to enter Focus mode when entering Advanced Edit mode.

## Enter advanced edit mode

An **Edit** button appears if:

* The `advancedEditModeSupport` property is set in the *capabilities.json* file to either `SupportedNoAction` or `SupportedInFocus`.

* The visual is viewed in report editing mode.

If the `advancedEditModeSupport` property is missing from the *capabilities.json* file or set to `NotSupported`, the **Edit** button doesn't appear.

When you select **Edit**, the visual gets an `update()` call with `EditMode` set to `Advanced`. Depending on the value that's set in the *capabilities.json* file, the following actions occur:

* `SupportedNoAction`: The host doesn't require further action.
* `SupportedInFocus`: The host pops out the visual into Focus mode.

## Exit advanced edit mode

The **Back to report** button appears if the `advancedEditModeSupport` property is set in the *capabilities.json* file to `SupportedInFocus`.
