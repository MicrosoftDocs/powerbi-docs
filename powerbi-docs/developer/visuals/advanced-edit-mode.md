# Advanced edit mode in Power BI visuals

Advanced edit mode enables you to use advanced UI controls in your Power BI visual. From report editing mode, select the **Edit** button on a visual and set the edit mode to **Advanced**. The visual uses the `EditMode` flag to determine if it should display this UI control.

By default, the visual doesn't support advanced edit mode (`"advancedEditModeSupport: 0"`). To enable Advanced edit mode, add a line to the visual's *capabilities.json* file by setting the `advancedEditModeSupport` property.

The possible values are:

- `0` - **NotSupported**. The visual doesn't support Advanced edit mode. The **Edit** button is not displayed on this visual.
- `1` - **SupportedNoAction**. The visual supports Advanced edit mode and doesn't require any further changes.
Power BI doesn't switch the visual to *Focus* Mode. Developers can use this setting as an external button to run several processes in the same viewport.
- `2` - **SupportedInFocus**. The visual supports Advanced edit mode and requires the host to enter Focus mode when entering Advanced edit mode.

## Enter advanced edit mode

An **Edit** button is displayed if:

- The `advancedEditModeSupport` property is set in the *capabilities.json* file to either `SupportedNoAction` or `SupportedInFocus`.
- The visual is viewed in report editing mode.

If `advancedEditModeSupport` property is missing from the *capabilities.json* file or set to `NotSupported`, the **Edit** button doesn't appear.

When you select **Edit**, the visual gets an update() call with EditMode set to `Advanced`. Depending on the value that's set in the *capabilities.json* file, the following actions occur:

- `SupportedNoAction`: The host doesnâ€™t require further action.
- `SupportedInFocus`: The host pops out the visual in Focus mode.

## Exit advanced edit mode

The **Back to report** button appears if the `advancedEditModeSupport` property is set in the *capabilities.json* file to `SupportedInFocus`.
