# Apply a selection to multiple visuals in a report

The `supportsMultiVisualSelection` feature enables you to select values from one visual in a Power BI report and apply the selected values to all the visuals in that report.

For example, in the **Overview** page of the [Retail Analysis sample](../../create-reports/sample-retail-analysis.md):

1. Select the **Total Sales Variance %, Sales Per Sq Ft and This Year Sales by District and District** visual. In the **Filters** pane that appears, under **Chain**, select **Fashions Direct**.

2. Select the **Total Sales Variance by FiscalMonth and District Manager** visual. In the **Filters** pane that appears, under **FiscalMonth**, select **Jan**.

In the report, these selections apply to all visuals that support this feature. The scope of the visuals is now limited to **Fashions Direct** and **January**.

## Enable the support multiple visual selection feature

To use the support multiple visual selection feature, add the following code to the *capabilities.json* file of your visual:

```json
    {   
            ...
        "supportsMultiVisualSelection": true
            ...
    }
```

## Considerations and limitations

* This feature requires API v3.2.0 or later.
* This feature doesn't apply to image visuals.
* This feature doesn't apply to certain advanced visuals, such as key driver, decomposition tree, Q&A, textbox, and gauge chart visuals.
