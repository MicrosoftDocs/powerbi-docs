# Power BI visuals system integration

The article describes the [Visual API](./visual-api.md), and how Power BI handles the interactions between the user, visual, and host.

The [`update` method](visual-api.md#update) is called whenever the visual's size or any of its values changes. The `update` method contains the main logic of the visual and is responsible for rendering a chart or visualizing data.

Actions and subsequent updates in Power BI can be initiated by the user or by the visual itself. They usually occur in one of the following three patterns:

* [User interacts with a visual through Power BI](#user-interacts-with-a-visual-through-power-bi).
* [User interacts with the visual directly](#user-interacts-with-the-visual-directly).
* [Visual interacts with Power BI](#visual-interacts-with-power-bi).

The following figure shows how common visual-based actions, like selecting a bookmark, are processed in Power BI.

## User interacts with a visual through Power BI

The user can interact with Power BI to update a visual in the following ways:

* A user opens the visual's properties panel.

    When a user opens the visual's properties panel, Power BI fetches supported objects and properties from the visual's *capabilities.json* file. To receive actual values of properties, Power BI calls the `getFormattingModel` method of the visual (APIs earlier than version 5.0 call `enumerateObjectInstances` instead). The API returns modern format pane model components, properties, and their actual values.

    For more information, see [Capabilities and properties of Power BI visuals](capabilities.md).

* A user [changes a property of the visual](../../visuals/power-bi-visualization-customize-title-background-and-legend.md) in the format panel.

    When a user changes the value of a property in the format panel, Power BI calls the `update` method of the visual. Power BI passes in the new `options` object to the `update` method. The objects contain the new values.

    For more information, see [Objects and properties of Power BI visuals](objects-properties.md).

* A user resizes the visual.

    When a user changes the size of a visual, Power BI calls the `update` method with the new `options` object. The `options` objects have nested `viewport` objects that contain the new width and height of the visual.

* A user applies a filter at the report, page, or visual level.

    Power BI filters data based on filter conditions. Power BI calls the `update` method of the visual to update the visual with new data.

    The visual gets a new update of the `options` objects when there's new data in one of the nested objects. How the update occurs depends on the data view mapping configuration of the visual.

    For more information, see [Understand data view mapping in Power BI visuals](dataview-mappings.md).

* A user selects a data point in another visual in the report.

    When a user selects a data point in another visual in the report, Power BI filters or highlights the selected data points and calls the visual's `update` method. The visual gets new filtered data, or it gets the same data with an array of highlights.

    For more information, see [Highlight data points in Power BI visuals](highlight.md).

* A user selects a bookmark in the bookmarks panel of the report.

  When a user selects a bookmark in the report's bookmarks panel, one of the following two actions can occur:

  * Power BI calls a function that's passed and registered by the `registerOnSelectionCallback` method. The callback function gets arrays of selections for the corresponding bookmark.
  * Power BI calls the `update` method with a corresponding `filter` object inside the `options` object.

    In either case, the visual must change its state according to the received selections or `filter` object.

    For more information about bookmarks and filters, see [Visual Filters API in Power BI visuals](filter-api.md).

## User interacts with the visual directly

The user can also interact directly with the visual to update it as follows:

* A user hovers the mouse over a data element.

    A visual can display more information about a data point through the Power BI Tooltips API. When a user hovers the mouse over a visual element, the visual can handle the event and display data about the associated tooltip element. The visual can display either a standard tooltip or a report page tooltip.

    For more information, see [Tooltips in Power BI visuals](add-tooltips.md).

* A user changes visual properties (For example, by expanding a tree) and the visual saves the new state in the visual properties.

    A visual can save properties values through the Power BI API. For example, when a user interacts with the visual and the visual needs to save or update properties values, the visual can call the `persistProperties` method.

* A user selects a URL.

    By default, a visual can't open a URL directly. Instead, to open a URL in a new tab, the visual can call the `launchUrl` method and pass the URL as a parameter.

    For more information, see [Create a launch URL](launch-url.md).

* A user applies a filter through the visual.

    A visual can call the `applyJsonFilter` method and pass conditions to filter for data in other visuals. Several types of filters are available, including Basic, Advanced, and Tuple filters.

    For more information, see [Visual Filters API in Power BI visuals](filter-api.md).

* A user selects elements in the visual.

    For more information about selections in a Power BI visual, see [Add interactivity by using Power BI visual selections](selection-api.md).

## Visual interacts with Power BI

Sometimes the visual initiates communication with the Power BI host without any input from the user:

* A visual requests more data from Power BI.

    A visual processes data part by part. The `fetchMoreData` API method requests the next fragment of data in the dataset.

    For more information, see [Fetch more data from Power BI](fetch-more-data.md).

* The event service triggers.

    Power BI can export a report to PDF or send a report by e-mail (applies only to certified visuals). To notify Power BI that rendering is finished and that the visual is ready to be captured as PDF or e-mail, the visual should call the Rendering Events API.

    For more information, see [Export reports from Power BI to PDF](../../consumer/end-user-pdf.md).

    To learn about the event service, see [Render events in Power BI visuals](event-service.md).
