# The hierarchical identity filters API in Power BI visuals

The **Hierarchy Identity filter API** enables visuals that use [Matrix DataView Mapping](./dataview-mappings.md#matrix-data-mapping) to filter data on multiple fields at a time based on data points that use a [hierarchy structure](./dataview-mappings.md#hierarchical-structure-of-matrix-data).

This API is useful in the following scenarios:

* Filtering hierarchies based on data points
* Custom visuals that use semantic models with group on keys

> [!NOTE]
> The Hierarchy Identity filter API is available from API version **5.9.0**

The filter interface is shown in the following code:

```typescript
interface IHierarchyIdentityFilter<IdentityType> extends IFilter {
    target: IHierarchyIdentityFilterTarget;
    hierarchyData: IHierarchyIdentityFilterNode<IdentityType>[];
}
```

* *$schema*: `https://powerbi.com/product/schema#hierarchyIdentity` (inherited from IFilter)

* *filterType*: FilterType.HierarchyIdentity (inherited from IFilter)

* *target*: Array of relevant columns in the query. Currently only a single role is supported; therefore, the target isn't required and should be empty.

* *hierarchyData*: the selected and unselected items in a hierarchy tree where each `IHierarchyIdentityFilterNode<IdentityType>` represents a single value selection.

```typescript
type IHierarchyIdentityFilterTarget = IQueryNameTarget[]

interface IQueryNameTarget {
    queryName: string;
}
```

* *queryName*: query name of the source column in the query. It comes from the `DataViewMetadataColumn`

```typescript
interface IHierarchyIdentityFilterNode<IdentityType> {
    identity: IdentityType;
    children?: IHierarchyIdentityFilterNode<IdentityType>[];
    operator: HierarchyFilterNodeOperators;
}
```

* *identity*: The Node identity in DataView. The `IdentityType` Should be `CustomVisualOpaqueIdentity`

* *children*: List of node children relevant to the current selection

* *operator*: The operator for single objects in the tree. The operator can be one of the following three options:

  ```typescript
  type HierarchyFilterNodeOperators = "Selected" | "NotSelected" | "Inherited";
  ```
  
  * *Selected*: value is explicitly selected.

  * *NotSelected*: value is explicitly not selected.

  * *Inherited*: value selection is according to the parent value in the hierarchy, or default if it's the root value.

Keep the following rules in mind when defining your hierarchy identity filter:

* Take the identities from the *DataView*.
* Each *identity* path should be a valid path in the *DataView*.
* Every leaf should have an operator of *Selected* or *NotSelected*.
* To compare identities, use the `ICustomVisualsOpaqueUtils.compareCustomVisualOpaqueIdentities` function.
* The identities might change following fields changes (for example, adding or removing fields). Power BI  assigns the updated identities to the existing filter.hierarchyData.

## How to use the Hierarchy identity filter API

The following code is an example of how to use the hierarchy identity filter API in a custom visual:

```typescript
import { IHierarchyIdentityFilterTarget, IHierarchyIdentityFilterNode, HierarchyIdentityFilter } from "powerbi-models"

const target: IHierarchyIdentityFilterTarget = [];

const hierarchyData: IHierarchyIdentityFilterNode<CustomVisualOpaqueIdentity>[] = [
    {
        identity: {...},
        operator: "Selected",
        children: [
            {
                identity: {...},
                operator: "NotSelected"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        identity: {...},
        operator: "Inherited",
        children: [
            {
                identity: {...},
                operator: "Selected"
            }
        ]
    }
];

const filter = new HierarchyIdentityFilter(target, hierarchyData).toJSON();
```

To apply the filter, use the `applyJsonFilter` API call:

```typescript
this.host.applyJsonFilter(filter, "general", "filter", action);
```

To restore the active JSON filter, use the `jsonFilters` property found in the "VisualUpdateOptions":

```typescript
export interface VisualUpdateOptions extends extensibility.VisualUpdateOptions {
   //...
   jsonFilters?: IFilter[];
}
```

## Hierarchy related fields validation (optional)

The `HierarchyIdnetity` filter is supported only for hierarchically related fields. By default, Power BI doesn't validate if the fields are hierarchically related.

To activate hierarchically related validation, add the 'areHierarchicallyRelated' property to the relevant role condition in the capabilities.json file:

```typescript
"dataViewMappings": [
    {
         "conditions": [
             {
                  "Rows": {
                      "min": 1,
                      "areHierarchicallyRelated": true <------ NEW ------>
                  },
                  "Value": {
                  "min": 0
                  }
            }
        ],
        ...
    }
]
```

Fields are hierarchically related if the following conditions are met:

* No included relationship edge is many to many cardinality, nor `ConceptualNavigationBehavior.Weak`.

* All fields in the filter exist in the path.

* Every relationship in the path has the same direction or bidirectional.

* The relationship direction matches the cardinality for one to many or bidirectional.

### Example of hierarchy relationships

For example, given the following entity relationship:

:::image type="content" source="./media/hierarchy-filter-api/hierarchy-filter-example.png" alt-text="Diagram showing the bidirectional nature of the filter.":::

* A, B are hierarchically related: true
* B, C are hierarchically related: true
* A, B, C are hierarchically related: true
* A, C, E are hierarchically related: true (A --> E --> C)
* A, B, E are hierarchically related: true (B --> A --> E)
* A, B, C, E are hierarchically related: true (B --> A --> E --> C)
* A, B, C, D are hierarchically related: false (violated rule #3)
* C, D are hierarchically related: true
* B, C, D are hierarchically related: false (violated rule #3)
* A, C, D, E are hierarchically related: false (violated rule #3)

> [!NOTE]

> * When these validations are enabled, and the fields are not hierarchically related, the visual won't render, and an error message will be displayed:
>
>    :::image type="content" source="./media/hierarchy-filter-api/validated-unsupported-relationships.png" alt-text="Screenshot of visual with validations enabled failing to load because the fields aren't hierarchically related.

## Code example for updating the hierarchy data tree after new selection

The following code shows how to update the `hierarchyData` tree after new a selection:

```typescript
type CompareIdentitiesFunc = (id1: CustomVisualOpaqueIdentity, id2: CustomVisualOpaqueIdentity) => boolean;
/**
* Updates the filter tree following a new node selection.
* Prunes irrelevant branches after node insertion/removal if necessary.
* @param path Identities path to the selected node.
* @param treeNodes Array of IHierarchyIdentityFilterNode representing a valid filter tree.
* @param compareIdentities Compare function for CustomVisualOpaqueIdentity to determine equality. Pass the ICustomVisualsOpaqueUtils.compareCustomVisualOpaqueIdentities function.
* @returns A valid filter tree after the update
*/

function updateFilterTreeOnNodeSelection(
   path: CustomVisualOpaqueIdentity[],
   treeNodes: IHierarchyIdentityFilterNode<CustomVisualOpaqueIdentity>[],
   compareIdentities: CompareIdentitiesFunc
): IHierarchyIdentityFilterNode<CustomVisualOpaqueIdentity>[] {
    if (!path) return treeNodes;
    const root: IHierarchyIdentityFilterNode<CustomVisualOpaqueIdentity> = {
        identity: null,
        children: treeNodes || [],
        operator: 'Inherited',
    };
    let currentNodesLevel = root.children;
    let isClosestSelectedParentSelected = root.operator === 'Selected';
    let parents: { node: IHierarchyIdentityFilterNode<CustomVisualOpaqueIdentity>, index: number }[] = [{ node: root, index: -1 }];
    let shouldFixTree = false;
    path.forEach((identity, level) => {
        const index = currentNodesLevel.findIndex((node) => compareIdentities(node.identity, identity));
        const isLastNodeInPath = level === path.length - 1
        if (index === -1) {
           const newNode: IHierarchyIdentityFilterNode<CustomVisualOpaqueIdentity> = {
               identity,
               children: [],
               operator: isLastNodeInPath ? (isClosestSelectedParentSelected ? 'NotSelected' : 'Selected') : 'Inherited',
           };
           currentNodesLevel.push(newNode);
           currentNodesLevel = newNode.children;
           if (newNode.operator !== 'Inherited') {

## Considerations and limitations

* This filter is supported only for matrix dataView mapping.

* The visual should contain only one *grouping* [data role](./capabilities.md#datarole-properties).

* A visual that uses the Hierarchy identity filter type should apply only a single filter of this type.
