      - question: |
          What are licensed visuals?
        answer: |
          [Licensed visuals](./custom-visual-licenses.md) are Power BI visuals available from the [Microsoft commercial marketplace](https://appsource.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps?product=power-bi-visuals&exp=kyyw&page=1&filters=pay-as-you-go). All licensed visuals have a limited basic version available for free, and a version with more functionality available for purchase. You can try out a free version of the visual before you need to purchase a license. You can also assign licenses to other users in your organization.

      - question: |
          Do I have to pay when I install a visual?
        answer: |
          You can install the visual for free from [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps?product=power-bi-visuals&exp=kyyw&page=1&filters=pay-as-you-go) by selecting **Install free** and following the instructions there, or by [embedding it directly into your report](./import-visual.md#import-a-power-bi-visual-directly-from-appsource). This allows you to use the free features provided. For the full experience, however, you need to purchase the visual from [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps?product=power-bi-visuals&exp=kyyw&page=1&filters=pay-as-you-go). The pricing for each licensed visual is described in the *Plans + Pricing* tab.

  - name: License assignment
    questions:
      - question: |
          Who can assign licenses after the purchase is complete?
        answer: |
          The person who buys the visual is the owner, and only the owner can assign licenses. 
          
          > [!NOTE]
          > After buying the visual, the buyer (owner) is automatically assigned a license. Their license is available after [refreshing the report](#once-i-assign-a-license--how-long-does-it-take-until-i-can-use-it-). It might take a few minutes.

          If the tenant admin owns the licenses (organizational licenses), then any of the license admins (Global Admin, License Admin or User Admin) can manage the licenses.  
          However, if the license owner isn't an admin, then only the purchaser/owner can manage the subscription and licenses.

      - question: |
          How do we assign the licenses?
        answer: |
          Only the buyer (owner) can assign a license. You receive a license automatically within five minutes of purchasing the visual. If you want to assign a license to other users or update your subscription, go to [admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com/) and select the **License** link under the **Billing** node from the menu. A list of visuals appears.

          :::image type="content" source="./media/licensing-faq/assign-licenses.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Admin homepage with billing licenses selected.":::

           Select the Visual you want to assign licenses for. In the next page, select the user(s) you want to assign the licenses to.

      - question: |
          Once I assign a license, how long does it take until I can use it?
        answer: |
          > [!NOTE]
          > After you assign a license in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, the license should be available within a few minutes.
          
          If you were just assigned a license, refresh the report to activate it by doing one of the following:
          
           * If you're using the licensed visual in the Power BI Service, refresh the report by hitting <kbd>F5</kbd>.
           * If you're using the licensed visual in the Power BI Desktop, close and reopen it.
          
           If, after you refresh, the license is still not available, wait a while and try again. It could take up to five minutes.

      - question: |
          Can I sign in to Microsoft 365 admin center even if I'm not an admin?
        answer: |
          Yes. When you purchase a Power BI Visual subscription, you also get access to the Microsoft 365 admin center. You can manage your own license subscriptions from there, but can’t see or access any other subscriptions unless you're an admin.

      - question: |
          Do I have to assign a license to myself even if I'm the owner?
        answer: |
          No. Buyers get a license assigned to them automatically. It can take up to five minutes from the time of purchase [for the license to take effect](#once-i-assign-a-license--how-long-does-it-take-until-i-can-use-it-). If you want to add more users or update your subscription, go to the [admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/).

      - question: |
          As an admin can I see the subscriptions that were purchased in my organization?
        answer: |
          A tenant admin can see all subscriptions purchased under the tenant account, including the subscriptions purchased by non-admins.

      - question: |
          What happens if the subscription owner leaves the company?
        answer: |
          Even if the owner of the subscription leaves the company, tenant admin purchases (typically known as organizational purchases) continue to work as-is. If the owner was an admin, any license admin (Global Admin, License Admin, User Admin) can continue to manage the licenses. The subscriptions can be managed by any Billing Admin or Global Admin with access to the billing account used for purchase.  
          If the owner wasn't an admin, the license will continue to work as long as the subscription is active. However, the subscription can't be managed by anyone else.
          
      - question: |
          We're a global team. Can we assign licenses to someone working in another country/region?
        answer: |
          You can assign licenses to users in the same tenant that you purchased subscription under regardless of the location.

      - question: |
          As an admin, can I cancel offer purchase from AppSource?
        answer: |
          As a billing or global admin, you can see all subscriptions in the Microsoft 365 admin center, and you can cancel them.

      - question: |
          How can I get more help or support for managing licenses?
        answer: |
          For help managing licenses, [contact support](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/contact-microsoft-store-support-4f615f2a-6bbd-fd69-6695-ae213d63eef0)
