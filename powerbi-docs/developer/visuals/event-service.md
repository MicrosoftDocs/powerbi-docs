# "Rendering" events in Power BI visuals

In order to get a [visual certified](power-bi-custom-visuals-certified.md), it must include **rendering events**.
These events let listeners (primarily, *export to PDF* and *export to PowerPoint*) know when the visual is being rendered and when it is ready for export.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Any visual that exports data (for example, to a PowerPoint or *.pdf* file) must contain rendering events to ensure that the export doesn't begin before the visual finished rendering.

The **rendering events API** consists of three methods that should be called during rendering:

* `renderingStarted`: The Power BI visual code calls the `renderingStarted` method to indicate that the rendering process has started. **This method should always be the first line of the *update* method** since that is where the rendering process begins.

* `renderingFinished`: When rendering is completed successfully, the Power BI visual code calls the `renderingFinished` method to notify the listeners that the visual's image is ready for export. This method should be the **last line of code executed** when the visual updates. It's usually, but not always, the last line of the update method.

* `renderingFailed`: If a problem occurs during the rendering process, the Power BI visual doesn't render successfully. To notify the listeners that the rendering process hasn't been completed, the Power BI visual code should call the `renderingFailed` method. This method also provides an optional string to provide a reason for the failure.

> [!NOTE]
> *Rendering events* are a requirement for visuals certification. Without them your visual won't be approved by the Partner Center for publication. For more information, see [certification requirements](power-bi-custom-visuals-certified.md#certification-requirements).

## How to use the rendering events API

To call the rendering methods, you have to first import them from the *IVisualEventService*.

1. In your `visual.ts` file, include the line:

    ```typescript
    import IVisualEventService = powerbi.extensibility.IVisualEventService;
    ```

2. In the `IVisual` class include the line:

    ```typescript
    private events: IVisualEventService;
    ```

3. In the `constructor` method of the `IVisual` class

    ```typescript
    this.events = options.host.eventService;
    ```

You can now call the methods
`this.events.renderingStarted(options);`,
`this.events.renderingFinished(options);`, and
`this.events.renderingFailed(options);` where appropriate in your *update* method.

## Example 1: Visual without animations

Here's an example of a simple visual that uses the *render events* API.

```typescript
    export class Visual implements IVisual {
        ...
        private events: IVisualEventService;
        ...

        constructor(options: VisualConstructorOptions) {
            ...
            this.events = options.host.eventService;
            ...
        }

        public update(options: VisualUpdateOptions) {
            this.events.renderingStarted(options);
            ...
            this.events.renderingFinished(options);
        }
```

## Example 2: Visual with animations

If the visual has animations or asynchronous functions for rendering, the `renderingFinished` method should be called after the animation or inside async function, even if it's not the last line of the *update* method.

```typescript
    export class Visual implements IVisual {
        ...
        private events: IVisualEventService;
        private element: HTMLElement;
        ...

        constructor(options: VisualConstructorOptions) {
            ...
            this.events = options.host.eventService;
            this.element = options.element;
            ...
        }

        public update(options: VisualUpdateOptions) {
            this.events.renderingStarted(options);
            ...
            // Learn more at https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/README.md#transition_end
            d3.select(this.element).transition().duration(100).style("opacity","0").end().then(() => {
                // renderingFinished called after transition end
                this.events.renderingFinished(options);
            });
        }
```
