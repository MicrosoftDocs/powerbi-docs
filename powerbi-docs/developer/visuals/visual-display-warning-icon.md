# Add a display warning icon to your visual

In a Power BI visual, a display warning icon can notify the user of a possible problem or an error. Display warning icons can be useful in many cases, such as:

* A map  visual can display a warning icon when values are outside the latitude or longitude valid range.

* A pie chart visual can display a warning icon when it's displaying negative values that are mixed with positive ones.

* A cartesian chart can display a warning icon when infinity values are calculated. For example, if **Y** is zero, when dividing **X** by **Y**, the result is infinity.

When the icon appears, the user can hover over it to see the title of the warning message.

When the user selects the warning icon, a message that describes the problem appears in a pop-up window.

## Create a warning icon

You can create a warning icon with a customized message for a custom visual. The decision whether to raise the warning icon or not is up to you. As these examples demonstrate, the visual continues to function when the warning icon is displayed.

### Add a call to the update method

To add a display warning icon to your visual, invoke the `displayWarningIcon` method. The method is part of `IVisualHost` and is exposed using `powerbi-visuals-api`.

Add the following import to your file:

```javascript
import powerbiVisualsApi from "powerbi-visuals-api"; 
```

After you add the import, add a condition that determines when to display the warning icon. Use the examples in this article to view two optional conditions.

### Example 1: Check language compatibility

Localization is used to display visuals in the customer's native language, which is determent by the operating system's settings.

In this example, the visual compares the language of the visual, which is set to US English, to the language of the operating system. If the languages don't match, the warning icon is displayed.

```javascript
if (this.locale != 'en-US') { 

            this.host.displayWarningIcon('Language inconsistency', 'This visual supports only US English. For the visual to work as expected, set your browser's language to US English.'); 
        }
```

### Example 2: Compare colors in adjacent columns  

In this example, the display warning icon appears when two columns that are next to each other have the same color.

The `getColumnColorByIndex` method iterates through all the columns. If two adjacent columns have the same color, a warning icon is displayed.  

```javascript
let category = options.dataViews[0].categorical.categories[0]; 

let dataValue = options.dataViews[0].categorical.values[0]; 

let colorPalette = this.host.colorPalette; 

for (let i = 0, len = Math.max(category.values.length, dataValue.values.length); i < len-1; i++) { 

    const color1: string = getColumnColorByIndex(category, i, colorPalette); 

    const color2: string = getColumnColorByIndex(category, i+1, colorPalette); 

    if (color1 == color2) { 

        this.host.displayWarningIcon('Adjacent columns have the same color.', 'Columns that are next to each other have the same color. To change a column's color, use the data colors option in the Format tab.'); 
    } 

} 
```

## Considerations and limitations

* Some errors and warnings aren't caused by the visual. For example, the *Too many values. Not showing all data* error is derived from the Power BI service. Such errors and warnings get propagated before to your visual's calls. They take precedence over errors that originate from your visual's code. If an error occurs while loading data, before the visual's code is run and the display warning icon condition is met, the visual displays that error instead of the display warning icon error.

* The display warning is cleared during each rendering of the visual, for example, when new data is dragged into the visual. The visual's `update()` method is invoked after the visual is rendered. If the visual's warning is raised based on a condition that's checked in the update method, each time the visual is rendered, if the condition is met, the visual displays the warning again.

* Resizing a visual doesn't affect the warning icon.

The following limitations refer to the display icon text:

* The maximum length of the title is 70 characters

* The maximum length of the text is 2,000 characters

* The text is only displayed as plain text
