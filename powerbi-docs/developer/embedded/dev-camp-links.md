# Power BI Dev Camp

[Power BI Dev Camp](https://www.powerbidevcamp.net/) (third-party site) is an educational resource for developers who want to learn more about Power BI as a developer platform. It covers topics such as Power BI embedding and the development of Power BI visuals and custom connectors.

This article provides links to some of the Power BI Dev Camp resources.

## Tutorials

The Power BI Dev Camp tutorials are targeted toward developers who are interested in understanding how to embed Power BI items (such as reports, dashboards and tiles) and do other basic embedding tasks.

### [App-owns-data tutorials](#tab/app-owns-data-tutorials)

* [App-owns-data embedding with .NET 5](https://github.com/PowerBiDevCamp/DOTNET5-AppOwnsData-Tutorial) - A tutorial that shows developers how to create a .NET 5 MVC web application that implements Power BI embedding that uses the app-owns-data embedding model. The tutorial covers advanced topics such as adding project support for TypeScript by using `node.js`, and programming the Power BI REST API to generate multi-resource access tokens.

### [User-owns-data tutorials](#tab/user-owns-data-tutorials)

* [User-owns-data embedding with .NET 5](https://github.com/PowerBiDevCamp/DOTNET5-UserOwnsData-Tutorial) - A tutorial that shows developers how to create a .NET 5 MVC web application that implements Power BI embedding that uses the user-owns-data embedding model. The tutorial covers advanced topics such as adding project support for TypeScript by using `node.js` and programming the Power BI REST API to generate multi-resource access tokens.

* [NetCore user-owns-data tutorial](https://github.com/PowerBiDevCamp/NetCore-UserOwnsData-Tutorial) - A tutorial for using .NET Core 3.1 to develop web applications for Power BI.

---

* [Tabular-Object-Model-Tutorial](https://github.com/PowerBiDevCamp/Tabular-Object-Model-Tutorial) - A tutorial and sample code programming semantic model that use the Tabular Object Model with Power BI Desktop and the Power BI service via the XMLA endpoint.

* [PowerBI-PowerShell-Tutorial](https://github.com/PowerBiDevCamp/PowerBI-PowerShell-Tutorial) - Student files for the Power BI PowerShell tutorial from Power BI Dev Camp.

## Examples

The Power BI Dev Camp examples provide additional resources for developers who are looking to embed Power BI items (such as reports, dashboards and tiles).

### [App-owns-data examples](#tab/app-owns-data-examples)

* [App-owns-data hello world](https://github.com/PowerBiDevCamp/AppOwnsDataHelloWorld) - A minimal .NET 5 application example to embed either a standard Power BI report or a paginated report. You can run and test the code in either Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio 2019. It also includes details for updating the settings for URLs and Azure ID resource IDs when you use a Power BI cloud other than the public cloud.

* [App-owns-data custom web API](https://github.com/PowerBiDevCamp/AppOwnsDataWebApi) - A .NET 5 custom web API example, with a single-page application (SPA) client created by using JavaScript. The custom web API interacts with the Power BI service API as a service principal, and returns embedding data and embed tokens to the client. This example demonstrates collecting telemetry from the SPA client and storing it in a custom database to monitor report loading performance.

* [App-owns-data and RLS](https://github.com/PowerBiDevCamp/AppOwnsDataWithRLS) - An example of a web application built by using .NET 5 and Power BI app-owns-data embedding. Created to demonstrate how to design a security authorization model that uses `EffectiveIdentity` and row-level security (RLS).

* [App-owns-data multitenant](https://github.com/PowerBiDevCamp/AppOwnsDataMultiTenant) - An example of a developer project demonstrating how to use service principal profiles to manage a multitenant environment with Power BI and app-owns-data embedding.

* [Salesforce app-owns-data embedding](https://github.com/PowerBiDevCamp/SalesforceAppOwnsDataEmbedding) - An example of a project that demonstrates how to implement app-owns-data embedding with Power BI reports. This project has been created by using the Salesforce developer experience (SFDX) and the Salesforce command-line interface (CLI). The goal of this example is to provide guidance and demonstrate best practices for developers who need to implement Power BI embedding in a Salesforce environment.

### [User-owns-data examples](#tab/user-owns-data-examples)

* [Salesforce user-owns-data embedding](https://github.com/PowerBiDevCamp/SalesforceUserOwnsDataEmbedding) - An example of a project that includes a simple single-page application (SPA) that implements user-owns-data embedding with Power BI reports. The solution is built by using three essential files, which include `index.html`, `app.css`, and `app.js`. This solution contains an optional fourth file named `loading.gif`, which is used to demonstrate a white-label loading technique in which the developer can display a custom loading image, instead of the standard Power BI branded loading image.

* [Tenant management application for Power BI](https://github.com/PowerBiDevCamp/TenantManagement) - A .NET 5 sample application that demonstrates how to manage service principals within a large-scale Power BI embedding environment with thousands of customer tenants.
