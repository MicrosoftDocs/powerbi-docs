# Embedded analytics solution accelerators from Microsoft partners

Microsoft's partners offer accelerators to expedite the integration of embedded analytics solutions with your applications. These accelerators are cost-effective and efficient, helping reduce the time to market for Power BI embedded analytics solutions, especially for multitenant, customer-facing applications. They're particularly useful for quickly advancing proof-of-concept (PoC) or pilot projects. Accelerators simplify the implementation process and help with managing Power BI capacity and billing.

Key advantages of using accelerators include:

* Enhanced Personalization and Functionality: Accelerators enhance user experience, offering personalized features for [Embed for your customers](./embedded-analytics-power-bi.md#embed-for-your-customers) scenario. This includes flexible options for end-user authentication, authorization, multitenancy, and permissions management.

* Simplified Implementation: The complex details of implementing Power BI embedded solutions are abstracted away. Some accelerators offer backend functionality through an SDK, with the need for other client front-end code development.

* Customization and White-Labeling: Once installed, you can white-label the solution, tailor its capabilities, and customize the user interface. White-label the solution, configure its capabilities, and customize the user experience once installed.​

* Acquisition and Ownership: Accelerators are developed and owned by Microsoft's partners and need to be purchased directly from them. They're cloud-based solutions deployed in your Azure environment, utilizing Azure and Fabric with Power BI services from Microsoft. Existing Microsoft subscriptions or licenses can be reused, the accelerators are also available for deployment through the Azure Marketplace.

* Integration Flexibility: Accelerators can function as standalone applications or be fully integrated with your existing application, as outlined in the [Deployment and integration options table](#deployment-and-integration-options).

Different partner accelerators vary in their deployment, acquisition/billing methods, and capabilities.
The following table briefly describes each of the current partners’ embedded analytics solution accelerators:"

There are several partner accelerators that vary in their deployment, acquisition/billing options and their capabilities. ​

## Accelerator capabilities

Different accelerators provide different frontend and backend capabilities including the following options:

### Frontend capabilities

The following capabilities are available with *all* accelerators:

* Seamless data isolation per application tenant and data and item permission per user

* Navigation menu for categories and items of Power BI

* Action bar outside of Power BI iFrame to control the UX and invoke functionality (including to toggle between view and edit modes)
