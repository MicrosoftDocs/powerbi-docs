# Embedded analytics solution accelerators from Microsoft partners

Microsoft's partners offer accelerators to expedite the integration of embedded analytics solutions with your applications. These accelerators are designed to be cost-effective and efficient, reducing the time-to-market for your Power BI embedded analytics solutions, particularly for multitenant, customer-facing applications. They're particularly useful for quickly advancing proof-of-concept (PoC) or pilot projects. Accelerators simplify the implementation process and assist in managing Power BI capacity and billing.

Key advantages of using accelerators include:

* Enhanced Personalization and Functionality: Accelerators enhance user experience, offering personalized features for [Embed for your customers](./embedded-analytics-power-bi.md#embed-for-your-customers) scenario. This includes flexible options for end-user authentication, authorization, multitenancy, and permissions management.

* Simplified Implementation: The complex details of implementing Power BI embedded solutions are abstracted away. Some accelerators offer backend functionality through an SDK, with the need for additional client front-end code development.

* Customization and White-Labeling: Once installed, you can white-label the solution, tailor its capabilities, and customize the user interface. White-label the solution, configure its capabilities, and customize the user experience once installed.​

* Acquisition and Ownership: Accelerators are developed and owned by Microsoft's partners and need to be purchased directly from them. They're cloud-based solutions deployed in your Azure environment, utilizing Azure and Fabric with Power BI services from Microsoft. Existing Microsoft subscriptions or licenses can be reused, the accelerators are also available for deployment through the Azure Marketplace.

* Integration Flexibility: Accelerators can function as standalone applications or be fully integrated with your existing application, as outlined in the [Deployment and integration options table](#deployment-and-integration-options).

Different partner accelerators vary in their deployment, acquisition/billing methods, and capabilities.
The following table briefly describes each of the current partners’ embedded analytics solution accelerators:"

There are several partner accelerators that vary in their deployment, acquisition/billing options and their capabilities. ​

## Accelerator capabilities

Different accelerators provide different frontend and backend capabilities including the following options:

### Frontend capabilities

* Navigation menu for categories and items of Power BI​

* Action bar above the Power BI iFrame to control the UX and invoke functionality  ​

  * End user bookmark management & visual personalization​

  * Export report to file printouts (PDF, PPTX, PNG, and more for Paginated reports)​

  * UX pane control and report edit/view toggle​

  * Report subscriptions and scheduling of printouts​

* Seamless multitenancy and user permissions support​

  * Show each tenant user only their own data even when using the same report across the tenant

  * Show the user only the items and data they have access to

  * Allow switching to edit mode based on user permissions (access level on report) ​

* Multi-language support for web frontend

To see which partner's solution contains which options, see the [comparison tables](#comparison-of-accelerators-from-our-partners).

### Backend capabilities

The following features and capabilities are available in the backend and admin modules of the accelerators:

#### Backend module​

* Support multiple end user authentication providers, potentially a different one per tenant​

* Generate and refresh access and embed tokens per tenant workspace isolation and user permissions​

* Support frontend features: asynchronous print to file and report subscriptions, scheduling & distribution​

* Expose backend SDK for your custom frontend embedded as iFrame in the existing ISV app​

#### Admin module (including UI and config database)​

* Multitenancy solution management within the same Power BI tenant

  * Auto provision workspace when on-boarding a new tenant​

  * Isolate tenants’ data and reports in their respective workspaces ​
