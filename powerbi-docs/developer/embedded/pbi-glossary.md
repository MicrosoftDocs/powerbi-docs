# Glossary for Power BI developers

Power BI may introduce terminology that is unfamiliar or confusing. This glossary is a great place to look up terminology, you might even want to keep it bookmarked. Other great resources for learning about the building blocks that make up Power BI are [Power BI service basic Concepts](../../consumer/end-user-basic-concepts.md) and [Basic concepts for designers](../../fundamentals/service-basic-concepts.md). These articles give a high-level overview of the Power BI *pieces* and how they're connected.

This glossary is a community effort.  Don't see a word here? Ask us to add it (you can use the documentation feedback button at the bottom of this article).

## A

### Account

Use your work or school account to sign in to Power BI. Administrators manage work or school accounts in Azure Active Directory. Your level of access is determined by the Power BI license associated with that account and the capacity type where content is stored. See **license** and **Premium**, below.

### Admin portal

The location where Power BI admins manage users, features, and settings for Power BI in their organization. (Note: Microsoft 365, Azure, and PowerApps use admin center.)

### Aggregates

When the values of multiple rows are grouped together as input on criteria to form a single value of more significant meaning or measurement. Only implicit measures (see definition below) can be aggregated.

### Aggregation

The reduction of rows in underlying data sources to fit in a model. The result is an aggregate.

### Alert, alerts

A feature that notifies users of changes in the data based on limits they set. Alerts can be set on tiles pinned from report visuals. Users receive alerts on the service and on their mobile app.

### Annotate

To write lines, text, or stamps on a snapshot copy of a tile, report, or visual on the Power BI mobile app for iOS and Android devices.

### App, apps

A bundle of dashboards, reports, and semantic models. It also refers to the mobile apps for consuming content, such as Power BI app for iOS.

### AppSource

Centralized online repository where you can browse and discover dashboards, reports, semantic models, and apps to download.

### ArcGIS for Power BI

ArcGIS is a mapping and analytics platform created by the company ESRI. The name of the visual included in the Power BI visuals library is called ArcGIS for Power BI.

### Artifacts

See [item](#item)

### Auto Insights

Auto insights are now called [Quick Insights](#quick-insights).

### Azure AD, Azure Active Directory

The identity service in Microsoft Azure that provides identity management and access control capabilities through a REST-based API.

### Azure Key Vault

The pay-as-you-go security solution that uses a single location (the vault) in Azure to store, secure and manage cryptographic keys and secrets that can then be invoked by URI and used by applications for small, high-value security data, such as authentication keys, storage account keys, data encryption keys, .pfx files, and passwords.

## B

### BI, business intelligence

### Bookmark

A view of data captured in the Bookmarks pane of a report in Power BI Desktop or service. In Desktop, the bookmarks are saved in the .pbix report file for sharing on the Power BI service
  
### Breadcrumbs

The navigation at the top left to quickly navigate between reports and dashboards.

## C

### Capacity

A capacity is a dedicated set of resources reserved for exclusive use. It offers dependable, consistent performance for your content.

### Card (visual type)

A Power BI [visual type](../../visuals/power-bi-visualization-types-for-reports-and-q-and-a.md).

### Card (Power BI Home)

Power BI Home displays rectangular and square pictures that represent dashboards, reports, apps, and more. These pictures are referred to as *cards*.

### Certified custom visual

A Power BI custom visual that has met requirements and passed strict security testing.

### Connect live

A method of connecting to SQL Server Analysis Services data models. Also called a live connection.

### Connector

Power BI Desktop includes an ever-growing collection of data connectors that are built to connect to a specific data source. Examples include: GitHub, MailChimp, Power BI dataflows, Google Analytics, Python, SQL Server, Zendesk, and more than 100 other data sources.

### Container

The areas on the navigation pane are *containers*. In the nav pane you'll find containers for: Favorites, Recent, Apps, Shared with me, and Home.

### Content

Content for the Power BI service is generally dashboards, reports, and apps. It can also include workbooks and semantic models.

### Content list

The content index for an app.

### Content view

The view in Windows Explorer that displays the most relevant content for each item based on its file name extension or Kind association.

### Continuous variable

A continuous variable can be any value between its minimum and maximum limits, otherwise it's a discrete variable. Examples are temperature, weight, age, and time. Continuous variables can include fractions or portions of the value. The total number of blue skateboards sold is a discrete variable since we can't sell half a skateboard.

### Correlation

A correlation tells us how the behaviors of things are related.  If their patterns of increase and decrease are similar, then they're positively correlated. And if their patterns are opposite, then they're negatively correlated. For example, if sales of our red skateboard increase each time we run a tv marketing campaign, then sales of the red skateboard and the tv campaign are positively correlated.

### Cross-filter

Applies to visual interactions.
Cross-filtering removes data that doesn't apply. For example, selecting **Moderation** in the doughnut chart cross-filters the line chart. The line chart now only displays data points that apply to the Moderation segment.

### Cross-highlight

Applies to visual interactions. Cross-highlighting retains all the original data points but dims the portion that doesn't apply to your selection. For example, selecting **Moderation** in the doughnut chart cross-highlights the column chart. The column chart dims all the data that doesn't apply to the Moderation segment, and highlights all the data that does apply to the Moderation segment.

### Custom visual

Visuals that are created by the community and Microsoft. They can be downloaded from the Office store for use in Power BI reports. You can also develop your own personalized custom visual.

## D

### Dashboard

In the Power BI service, a dashboard is a single page, often called a canvas, that uses visualizations to tell a story. Because it's limited to one page, a well-designed dashboard contains only the most important elements of that story. Dashboards can only be created and viewed in the Power BI service, not in Power BI Desktop. For more information, see [basic concepts, dashboards](../../consumer/end-user-basic-concepts.md#dashboards).

### Data connector

See connectors

### Data model, Excel Data Model

In Power BI content, a data model refers to a map of data structures in a table format. The data model shows the relationships that are being used to build databases. Report designers, administrators, and developers create and work with data models to create Power BI content.

### Dataflow

Dataflows ingest, transform, integrate, and enrich big data by defining data source connections, ETL logic, refresh schedules, and more. Formerly data pool.

### Semantic model

A collection of data used to create visualizations and reports.

### DAX expression

**Data Analysis Expressions**. A Microsoft formula language used to [build formulas and expressions](/training/modules/dax-power-bi-write-formulas/) in Power BI Desktop, Azure Analysis Services, SQL Server Analysis Services, and Power Pivot in Excel.

### **Desktop** or **Power BI Desktop**

Free Power BI tool used primarily be report designers, admins, and developers.

### Diamond

Power BI Premium. The shape of the icon that signifies a workspace is a Premium capacity workspace.

### Dimension

Dimensions are categorical (text) data. A dimension describes a person, object, item, products, place, and time. In a semantic model, dimensions are a way to group [*measures*](#measure) into useful categories. For our skateboard company, some dimensions might include looking at sales (a measure) by model, color, country/region, or marketing campaign.

### Drill up, drill down, drill through

In Power BI, "drill down" and "drill up" refer to the ability to explore the next level of detail in a report or visual.
"Drill through" refers to the ability to select a part of a visual and be taken to another page in the report, filtered to the data that relates to the part of the visual you selected on the original page.
Drill to details commonly means to show the underlying records.

## E

### Editing View

The mode in which report *designers* can explore, design, build, and share a report.

### Effective identity

The identity used by the generate token API to generate a token for an individual user, depending on that user's credentials in the app. It could be a master user or service principal.

### Ellipsis

Three dots - ...
Selecting an ellipsis displays more menu options. Also referred to as the **More actions** menu.

### Embed code

A common standard across the internet. In Power BI, the customer can generate an embed code and copy it to place content such as a report visual on a website or blog.

### Embed token

A string of encrypted characters that is used for authentication, which specifies the content the web app user can access and the user’s access level.

### Embedded

See Power BI Embedded.

### Embedding

In the Power BI developer offering, the process of integrating analytics into apps using the Power BI REST APIs and the Power BI SDK.

### Environment

[Power BI Desktop, Power BI Mobile, the Power BI service, etc.] Another way to refer to one of the Power BI tools. It's okay to use Power BI environment ([tenant](#tenant)) in documentation where it may help business analysts who are familiar with the term tenant to know it's the same thing.

### Explicit measures

Power BI uses explicit measures and implicit measures (see definition below). Explicit measures are created by report designers and saved with the semantic model. They're displayed in Power BI as fields, and can therefore be used over and over. For example, a report designer creates an explicit measure *TotalInvoice* that sums all invoice amounts. Colleagues who use that semantic model and who have edit access to the report, can select and use that field to create a visual. When an explicit measure is added or dragged onto a report canvas, Power BI doesn't apply an aggregation.  Creating explicit measures requires edit access to the semantic model.

## F

### Favorite, unfavorite

Verb meaning to add to the Favorites list for quick access to frequently visited dashboards and reports in Power BI. When you no longer want them as a favorite, you unfavorite them.

### **Filter** versus **highlight**

A filter *removes* data that doesn't apply. A highlight *grays out* the data that doesn't apply.

### Focus mode

Use focus mode to pop out a visual or tile to see more detail. You can still interact with the visual or tile while in focus mode. 

### Free account

See *account*

### Full screen, full-screen mode

Use full screen mode to view Power BI content without the distraction of menus and navigation panes. Full screen mode is sometimes referred to as TV mode.

## G

### **Gateways** or **on-premises data gateways**

A bridge to underlying data sources. It provides quick and secure data transfer between the Power BI service and on-premises data sources that support refresh. Managed by IT.

## H

### High-density visuals

Visuals with more data points than Power BI can render. Power BI samples the data to show the shape and outliers.

### Home

The default landing page for Power BI service users. Doesn't modify anything. Can be called Power BI Home or simply Home.

## I

### Inline frame, IFrame

An IFrame is component of an HTML element that allows you to embed reports and other [items](#item) inside your app. It's essentially a way to display a secondary webpage inside the main page.

### Implicit measures

Power BI uses implicit measures and explicit measures (see definition above). Implicit measures are created dynamically.  For example, when you drag a field onto the report canvas to create a visual. Power BI automatically aggregates the value using one of the built-in standard aggregations (SUM, COUNT, MIN, AVG, etc.). Creating implicit measures requires edit access to the report.

### Independent Software Vendor, ISV

A third-party software developer. An ISV can be an individual or an organization that independently creates computer software.

### Insights

See [**quick insights**](#quick-insights).

### Item

A component type of the Power BI workspace that includes dashboards, reports, semantic models, and data flows.
Formerly known as artifacts.

## J

## K

### KPIs

Key performance indicators. A type of visual.

## L

### Left navigation (left nav)

The controls along the left edge of Power BI service.

### License

Your level of access is determined by the Power BI license associated with your account and the capacity type where content is stored. For example, in shared capacity, a user with a Power BI Pro license can collaborate only with users who are also assigned a Pro license. In shared capacity, a free license enables access to only the user’s personal workspace. However, when content is in Premium capacity or Fabric F64 or greater capacity, users with a Pro license can share that content with users who are assigned a free license.

A license is assigned to a user and can be a free or Pro license. Depending on how the license was acquired, it may be paid or unpaid. The accounts are either: per-user or organizational. Per-user accounts are available as *free* or *Pro*.  A Power BI *free* user is either using stand-alone Power BI Desktop or is using Power BI service stand-alone or is using Power BI service within an organization that has a Premium organizational subscription. The Power BI per-user *Pro* account is a paid monthly subscription that allows for collaboration and sharing of content with other *Pro* users.

The organizational *Premium* (also known as *Premium capacity*) subscription adds a layer of features on top of per-user licenses. For example, *free* per-user account holders within an organization that has a *Premium* subscription, are able to do much more with Power BI than *free* users without *Premium*. For example, *free* users in *Premium* organizational accounts, can collaborate with colleagues and can view content that's hosted on Power BI Premium capacity.

### **List page** or **content list**

One of the section pages for the elements in the nav pane. For example, Favorites, Recents, My workspace, etc.

## M

### Measure

A measure is a quantitative (numeric) field that can be used to do calculations. Common calculations are sum, average, and minimum. For example, if our company makes and sells skateboards, our measures might be number of skateboards sold and average profit per year.

### Mobile app
