# What is Power BI embedded analytics?

[!INCLUDE[Customers no Org yes](../../includes/applies-embedded-app-yes-user-yes.md)]

Power BI embedded analytics allows you to embed your Power BI items such as reports, dashboards and tiles, in a web application or in a website. You can:

* Deliver compelling data experiences for your end users, enabling them to take action based on insights from your solutions data.

* Quickly and easily provide exceptional customer-facing reports, dashboards, and analytics in your own apps by using and branding Power BI as your own.

## Secure embed

[Secure embed](../../collaborate-share/service-embed-secure.md) is the simplest no-code way to embed a report into any portal that accepts a URL or iFrame. The viewer of the report must have the proper Power BI license. The viewer can interact with the report, but not edit, save, or make any changes to it. Secure embed is available in the Power BI service.

For more advanced solutions that give your users more flexibility and control, use one of the [Power BI embedded analytics solutions](#what-are-the-power-bi-embedded-analytics-solutions) described in this article.

## What are the Power BI embedded analytics solutions?

With Power BI embedded analytics you can integrate analytical and business intelligence (BI) capabilities *directly within applications* . This allows end users to explore, analyze, and visualize data on their own and enables faster and more intuitive decision-making without having to switch to separate BI tools outside of the applications.​

Key Features of Self-Service Embedded Analytics:​

* **User self-sufficiency** - can generate reports and analyze data without fully relying on IT/dev/data analysts​

  * User-Friendly Interface - designed for nontechnical users, interactive dashboards, and intuitive reporting tools​

  * Customization & Personalization - users can modify or create custom reports based on their needs​

* Integration within applications - such as CRM, ERP, or custom applications and accommodating scenarios such as:​

  * Near Real-Time Data Access - for up-to-date insights from the application’s data and multiple other sources of data​

  * Enabling actionable insights – user can drive action within the application based on data selected from the reports​

* Advanced Analytics Features - including AI-driven insights, predictive analytics, and automated data discovery.

Power BI embedded analytics offers two solutions:

* [Embed for your customers](#embed-for-your-customers)

* [Embed for your organization](#embed-for-your-organization)

### Embed for your customers

The *embed for your customers* solution allows you to build an app that uses non-interactive authentication against Power BI. Your customers are likely to be external users, and they don't need to sign in using Power BI credentials to view the embedded content. Typically, this solution is used by independent software vendors (ISVs) who are developing applications for third parties. For a tutorial, see [Embed Power BI content using a sample embed for your customers application](embed-customer-app.md).

### Embed for your organization

The *embed for your organization* solution allows you to build an app that requires signing in using Power BI credentials. Once signed in users can only consume embedded content, they have access to on Power BI service. This solution is aimed at large organizations that are building an app for internal users. For a tutorial, see [Embed Power BI content into an application for your organization](embed-organization-app.md).

## Comparison of the *embed for your customers* vs *embed for your organization* solutions

The following table provides a comparison between the two Power BI embedded analytics solutions.

|Embed for your customers  |Embed for your organization  |
|---------|---------|
|Also known as **app owns data**         |Also known as **user owns data**         |
|Aimed at external users         |Aimed at internal users         |
|To authenticate app users, use your own authentication method        |App users authenticate against Microsoft Entra ID         |
|App users don't need a license         |Each app user needs a Power BI license         |
|Non-interactive authentication. Your app uses a *service principal* or a *master user* to authenticate        |Interactive authentication. Your app uses the app user's credentials to authenticate         |

## What are Power BI capacities?

A capacity is a set of resources reserved for exclusive use. It enables you to publish dashboards, reports, and semantic models to users, without having to purchase per-user licenses. It also offers dependable, consistent performance for your content.  
For development testing, you can use free embed trial tokens with a Pro license. To embed in a production environment, you must use a capacity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Free trial tokens are limited to development testing only. For production, a capacity must be purchased. Until a capacity is purchased, the *Free trial version* banner continues to appear at the top of the embedded report.

There are two types of Power BI embedded analytics offerings and an offering from Microsoft Fabric. Each offer includes a different type of SKU that you use to buy a Power BI [capacity](./embedded-capacity.md):

* [Power BI Embedded](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/power-bi-embedded/#overview) is an Azure offer that includes A SKUs. *Power BI Embedded* is associated with the [*embed for your customers*](#embed-for-your-customers) solution.

* [Power BI Premium](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/power-bi-premium/) is a Microsoft Office offer that includes P or EM SKUs.

* [Microsoft Fabric](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-fabric/) is an Azure offer that includes F SKUs.

For more information about the differences between the Embedded and Premium SKUs, see [Capacity and SKUs in Power BI embedded analytics](embedded-capacity.md).
