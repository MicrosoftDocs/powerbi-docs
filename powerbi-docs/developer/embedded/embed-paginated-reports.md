# Embed Power BI paginated reports

With Power BI embedded analytics, you can create Power BI content that displays [paginated reports](../../paginated-reports/paginated-reports-report-builder-power-bi.md) in a fully integrated and interactive application. Embed paginated reports using the solution that works best for you, [embed for your customers](embedded-analytics-power-bi.md#embed-for-your-customers) or [embed for your organization](embedded-analytics-power-bi.md#embed-for-your-organization).

This article describes how to embed paginated reports using the embedding sample tutorials.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you're required to have:

## [Embed for your customers](#tab/customers)

* A [service principal](embed-service-principal.md)

* Your own [Azure Active Directory tenant](create-an-azure-active-directory-tenant.md) setup

* A [capacity](#step-2---create-a-capacity), with [paginated reports workload](../../enterprise/service-admin-premium-workloads.md#paginated-reports) enabled

    >[!NOTE]
    >You only need to enable this workload with Power BI Premium Gen1 capacities.


If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## [Embed for your organization](#tab/organization)

* A [Power BI Pro license](../../enterprise/service-admin-purchasing-power-bi-pro.md) or Premium Per User (PPU) license.

* You need to have your own [Azure Active Directory tenant](create-an-azure-active-directory-tenant.md) setup.

* A Premium capacity. See [What size Premium capacity do I need for paginated reports?](../../paginated-reports/paginated-reports-faq.yml#what-size-premium-capacity-do-i-need-for-paginated-reports-)

If you're not signed up for **Power BI Pro**, [sign up for a free trial](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/pricing/) before you begin.

## Method

To embed a paginated report using the sample app, follow these steps:

1. [Create a workspace](#step-1---create-a-workspace).

2. [Create a capacity](#step-2---create-a-capacity).

3. [Assign a workspace to a capacity](#step-3---assign-a-workspace-to-a-capacity).

4. [Enable paginated reports workload](#step-4---enable-paginated-reports-workload).

5. [Create and upload your paginated report](#step-5---create-and-upload-your-paginated-report).

6. [Embed content using the sample application](#step-6---embed-content-using-the-sample-application).

## Step 1 - Create a workspace

### [Embed for your customers](#tab/customers)

As you're using a [service principal](embed-service-principal.md) to sign into your application, you'll need to create a [workspace](../../collaborate-share/service-create-the-new-workspaces.md).

Your *service principal* must also be an admin or member of the Power BI workspaces.

### [Embed for your organization](#tab/organization)

In Power BI service, create a workspace for your paginated report.

---

## Step 2 - Create a capacity

### [Embed for your customers](#tab/customers)

Before you import or upload a paginated report to embed, the workspace containing the report must be assigned to a capacity. There are two types of capacity you can choose from:

* **Power BI Premium** - For embedding a paginated report, an *EM* or *P* SKU is required. For more information about this subscription, see [What is Power BI Premium?](../../enterprise/service-premium-gen2-what-is.md)
* **Azure Power BI Embedded** - You can purchase a capacity from the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). This subscription uses the *A* SKUs. For details on how to create a Power BI Embedded capacity, see [Create Power BI Embedded capacity in the Azure portal](azure-pbie-create-capacity.md).

The following table describes the resources and limits of each SKU. To determine which capacity best fits your needs, see the [which SKU should I purchase for my scenario](./embedded-faq.yml#which-solution-should-i-choose-) table.

| Capacity Nodes | V-cores | RAM (GB) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| EM1/A1 | 1 |  2.5 |
| EM2/A2 | 2 |  5   |
| EM3/A3 | 4 | 10   |
| P1/A4 |  8 |  25 |
| P2/A5 | 16 |  50 |
| P3/A6 | 32 | 100 |

### [Embed for your organization](#tab/organization)

By creating a capacity, you can take advantage of having a resource for the content in your app workspace. For paginated reports, you must back your app workspace with an *EM* or a *P* capacity. You can create a capacity by using [Power BI Premium](../../enterprise/service-premium-gen2-what-is.md).

The following table lists the Power BI Premium SKUs that can be used to create a capacity for paginated reports in [Microsoft Office 365](../../enterprise/service-admin-premium-purchase.md):

| Capacity node | V-cores | RAM (GB) | DirectQuery/live connection limits (per sec) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EM1/A1 with [Premium Gen2](../../enterprise/service-premium-gen2-what-is.md#capacities-and-skus) | 1 |   |  3.75 |
| EM2/A2 with [Premium Gen2](../../enterprise/service-premium-gen2-what-is.md#capacities-and-skus) | 2 |   |  7.5  |
| EM3/A3 with [Premium Gen2](../../enterprise/service-premium-gen2-what-is.md#capacities-and-skus) | 4 |   | 15    |
| P1/A4 |   8 |  25 |  30 |
| P2/A5 |  16 |  50 |  60 |
| P3/A6 |  32 | 100 | 120 |
| P4    |  64 | 200 | 240 |
| P5    | 128 | 400 | 480 |

---

## Step 3 - Assign a workspace to a capacity

### [Embed for your customers](#tab/customers)

Once you create a capacity, you can assign your app workspace to that capacity.

To assign a capacity to a workspace using a [service principal](embed-service-principal.md), use the [Power BI REST API](/rest/api/power-bi/capacities/groups_assigntocapacity). When you're using the Power BI REST APIs, make sure to use the [service principal object ID](embed-service-principal.md).

>[!NOTE]
>You can also import paginated reports into a workspace using the [Power BI REST APIs](/rest/api/power-bi/imports/postimportingroup).

### [Embed for your organization](#tab/organization)

After you create a capacity, you need to assign your workspace to that capacity. To complete this process, follow these steps:

1. Within the Power BI service, expand workspaces and select **More** for the workspace you're using for embedding your content. Then select **Workspace settings**.

    ![Edit a workspace](media/embed-paginated-reports/workspace-settings.png)

2. Select **Premium** and enable **Capacity**. Select the capacity you created. Then select **Save**.

    ![Assign a capacity](media/embed-paginated-reports/capacity.png)

3. After you select **Save**, you should see a diamond next to the app workspace name.

    ![App workspace tied to a capacity](media/embed-paginated-reports/diamond.png)

---

## Step 4 - Enable paginated reports workload

>[!NOTE]
>This step is only necessary for **Embedded Gen1**. If your capacity is Gen2, continue to [Step 5](#step-5---create-and-upload-your-paginated-report).

After creating a capacity and assigning your workspace to it, you need to enable the paginated report workload on your capacity.

1. Sign into [Power BI > Admin portal > Capacity settings](https://app.powerbi.com/admin-portal/capacities).

2. Select the capacity that has the workspace you want to add a paginated report to.

    ![Select capacity](media/embed-paginated-reports/select-capacity.png)

3. Expand **Workloads**.

    ![Expand workloads](media/embed-paginated-reports/expand-workloads.png)

4. Activate the paginated reports workload.

    ![Paginated reports workload](media/embed-paginated-reports/paginated-reports-workload.png)

## Step 5 - Create and upload your paginated report

You can create your paginated report using [Power BI Report Builder](../../paginated-reports/paginated-reports-report-builder-power-bi.md#create-reports-in-power-bi-report-builder), and then [upload the report to the service](../../paginated-reports/paginated-reports-quickstart-aw.md#upload-the-report-to-the-service).

>[!NOTE]
>The user uploading the paginated report needs a Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) license to publish to a workspace.

## Step 6 - Embed content using the sample application

### [Embed for your customers](#tab/customers)

Follow the instructions in the [embed content for your customers](embed-sample-for-customers.md) tutorial. Skip [Step 4 - Create and publish a Power BI report](embed-sample-for-customers.md#step-4---create-and-publish-a-power-bi-report) and use the paginated report you uploaded, instead of the sample report suggested in the tutorial.

* To use a **Power BI dataset** as a data source:

  * In the Power BI portal, set the **XMLA endpoint** to *Read Only* or *Read Write* as described in [enable read-write for a Premium capacity](/power-bi/enterprise/service-premium-connect-tools#to-enable-read-write-for-a-premium-capacity). You only need to do this once per capacity.
  * Generate a [multi-resource embed token](/rest/api/power-bi/embed-token/generate-token) with the [dataset ID](/rest/api/power-bi/embed-token/generate-token#generatetokenrequestv2dataset) specified in the request, and the [XmlaPermissions](/rest/api/power-bi/embed-token/generate-token#xmlapermissions) set to *Read Only*.

* To use a **Single Sign-on (SSO)** enabled data source:

  SSO-enabled data sources are supported if they're either directly connected to the paginated report, or connected to a Power BI dataset which is the data source of the paginated report. When embedding a paginated report with SSO-enabled data sources, the identity blob for the data source must be provided in the [`DatasourceIdentity`](/rest/api/power-bi/embed-token/generate-token#datasourceidentity) when you generate a [multi-resource embed token](/rest/api/power-bi/embed-token/generate-token).

### [Embed for your organization](#tab/organization)

Follow the instructions in the [embed content for your organization](embed-sample-for-your-organization.md) tutorial.

Skip [Step 3 - Create and publish a Power BI report](embed-sample-for-your-organization.md#step-3---create-and-publish-a-power-bi-report) and use the paginated report you uploaded, instead of the sample report suggested in the tutorial.

## Considerations and limitations

### [Embed for your customers limitations](#tab/customers)

* You must use a **service principal**. Master user isn't supported.
* [Premium Per User (PPU)](../../enterprise/service-premium-per-user-faq.yml) isn't supported.
* When embedding a paginated report with a Power BI dataset, both the paginated report and the Power BI dataset must reside in a Premium per capacity or Embedded workspace (they can reside in two different workspaces). The user generating the embed token should have *Write* permissions in the workspaces of both the report and the dataset.
* Embedding a paginated report connected to Azure Analysis Services with Single Sign-on (SSO) enabled is not supported

For a full list of supported datasets and their authentication methods, see [Supported data sources for Power BI paginated reports](../../paginated-reports/paginated-reports-data-sources.md#natively-supported-data-sources).

### [Embed for your organization limitations](#tab/organization)

[Premium Per User (PPU)](../../enterprise/service-premium-per-user-faq.yml) is supported. However, if you're using PPU, only PPU users in your organization will be able to access your solution.

---

* Paginated reports don't support client side events (like `loaded` or `rendered`)
