# Tutorial: Embed Power BI content using a sample *embed for your customers'* application

[!INCLUDE[Customers yes Org no](../../includes/applies-embedded-app-yes-user-no.md)]

**Embedded analytics** and **Power BI Embedded** (the Azure offer) allow you to embed Power BI content such as reports, dashboards and tiles, into your application.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

>[!div class="checklist"]
>
>* Set up your embedded environment.
>* Configure an *embed for your customers* (also known as *app owns data*) sample application.

To use your application, your users won't need to sign in to Power BI or have a Power BI license.

We recommend using the *embed for your customers* method to embed your Power BI content, if you're an independent software vendor (ISV) or a developer, who wants to create applications for third parties.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are embedding content for a national/regional cloud, the first few steps of this tutorial are different. See [Embed content for national/regional clouds](embed-sample-for-customers-national-clouds.md) for details.

## Code sample specifications

This tutorial includes instructions for configuring an *embed for your customers* sample application in one of the following frameworks:

* .NET Framework
* .NET Core
* Java
* Node JS
* Python

The code samples support the following browsers:

* Microsoft Edge
* Google Chrome
* Mozilla Firefox

## Prerequisites

Before you start this tutorial, verify that you have both the Power BI and code dependencies listed below:

* **Power BI dependencies**

  * Your own [Azure Active Directory tenant](create-an-azure-active-directory-tenant.md).

  * To authenticate your app against Power BI, you'll need one of the following:

    * [Service principal](embed-service-principal.md) - An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) [service principal object](/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals#service-principal-object) that allows Azure AD to authenticate your app.

    * [Power BI Pro](../../enterprise/service-admin-purchasing-power-bi-pro.md) license - This will be your **master user** and your app will use it to authenticate to Power BI.

    * A Power BI [Premium Per User (PPU)](../../enterprise/service-premium-per-user-faq.yml) license - This will be your **master user** and your app will use it to authenticate to Power BI.

## Method

To create an *embed for your customers* sample app, follow these steps:

1. [Select your authentication method](#step-1---select-your-authentication-method).

2. [Register an Azure AD application](#step-2---register-an-azure-ad-application).

3. [Create a Power BI workspace](#step-3---create-a-power-bi-workspace).

4. [Create and publish a Power BI report](#step-4---create-and-publish-a-power-bi-report).

5. [Get the embedding parameter values](#step-5---get-the-embedding-parameter-values).

6. [Service principal API access](#step-6---service-principal-api-access)

7. [Enable workspace access](#step-7---enable-workspace-access).

8. [Embed your content](#step-8---embed-your-content).

## Step 1 - Select your authentication method

Your embedded solution will vary depending on the authentication method you select. Therefore, it's important to understand the differences between the authentication methods, and decide which one best suits your solution.

The table below describes a few key differences between the [service principal](embed-service-principal.md) and **master user** authentication methods.

|Consideration  |Service principal  |Master user  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Mechanism     |Your Azure AD app's [service principal object](/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals#service-principal-object) allows Azure AD to authenticate your embedded solution app against Power BI.        |Your Azure AD app uses the credentials (username and password) of a Power BI user, to authenticate against Power BI.         |
|Security     |*Service principal* is the Azure AD recommended authorization method. If you're using a service principal, you can authenticate using either an *application secret* or a *certificate*.</br></br>This tutorial only describes using *service principal* with an *application secret*. To embed using a *service principal* and a *certificate*, refer to the [service principal with a certificate](embed-service-principal-certificate.md) article.         |This authentication method isn't as secure as  a *service principal*. You have to be vigilant with the *master user* credentials (username and password). For example, don't expose them in your embedding application, and change the password frequently.         |
|Azure AD delegated permissions |Not required. |Your *master user* or an administrator has to grant consent for your app to access Power BI REST API [permissions](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent) (also known as scopes). For example, *Report.ReadWrite.All*. |
|Power BI service access |You can't access Power BI service with a *service principal*.|You can access Power BI service with your *master user* credentials.|
|License     |Doesn't require a Pro license. You can use content from any workspace that you're a member or an admin of.         |Requires a [Power BI Pro](../../enterprise/service-admin-purchasing-power-bi-pro.md) or Premium Per User (PPU) license.         |

## Step 2 - Register an Azure AD application

Registering your application with Azure AD allows you to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
>
>* Establish an identity for your app
>* Let your app access the [Power BI REST APIs](/rest/api/power-bi/)
>* If you're using a *master user* - Specify your app's [Power BI REST permissions](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent)

[!INCLUDE[Register Azure AD app](../../includes/embed-tutorial-register-app.md)]

>[!NOTE]
>Before registering your application, you'll need to decide which authentication method to use, *service principal* or *master user*.

## Step 3 - Create a Power BI workspace

[!INCLUDE[Create a Power BI workspace](../../includes/embed-tutorial-create-workspace.md)]

## Step 4 - Create and publish a Power BI report

[!INCLUDE[Create a Power BI report](../../includes/embed-tutorial-create-report.md)]

## Step 5 - Get the embedding parameter values

To embed your content, you need to obtain certain parameter values. The table below shows the required values, and indicates if they're applicable to the *service principal* authentication method, the *master user* authentication method, or both.

Before you embed your content, make sure you have all the values listed below. Some of the values will differ, depending on the authentication method you're using.

|Parameter   |Service principal   |Master user  |
|-------------------|---|---|
|[Client ID](#client-id) |![Applies to.](../../media/yes.png) |![Applies to.](../../media/yes.png) |
|[Workspace ID](#workspace-id)     |![Applies to.](../../media/yes.png) |![Applies to.](../../media/yes.png) |
|[Report ID](#report-id)           |![Applies to.](../../media/yes.png) |![Applies to.](../../media/yes.png) |
|[Client secret](#client-secret) |![Applies to.](../../media/yes.png) |![Does not apply to.](../../media/no.png) |
|[Tenant ID](#tenant-id)                 |![Applies to.](../../media/yes.png) | required only for Node JS |
|[Power BI username](#power-bi-username-and-password)   |![Does not apply to.](../../media/no.png) |![Applies to.](../../media/yes.png) |
|[Power BI password](#power-bi-username-and-password)   |![Does not apply to.](../../media/no.png) |![Applies to.](../../media/yes.png) |

### Client ID

>[!TIP]
>**Applies to:** ![Applies to.](../../media/yes.png)Service principal ![Applies to.](../../media/yes.png)Master user

[!INCLUDE[Get the client ID](../../includes/embed-tutorial-client-id.md)]

### Workspace ID

>[!TIP]
>**Applies to:** ![Applies to.](../../media/yes.png)Service principal ![Applies to.](../../media/yes.png)Master user

[!INCLUDE[Get the workspace ID](../../includes/embed-tutorial-workspace-id.md)]

Alternatively, you can find the workspace ID in the **Admin portal** settings by selecting **Details** next to the workspace name.

  :::image type="content" source="media/embed-sample-for-customers/workspace-details.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to find the workspace I D from the admin settings.":::

### Report ID

>[!TIP]
>**Applies to:** ![Applies to.](../../media/yes.png)Service principal ![Applies to.](../../media/yes.png)Master user

[!INCLUDE[Get the report ID](../../includes/embed-tutorial-report-id.md)]

### Client secret

>[!TIP]
>**Applies to:** ![Applies to.](../../media/yes.png)Service principal ![Does not apply to.](../../media/no.png)Master user

[!INCLUDE[Get the client secret](../../includes/embed-tutorial-client-secret.md)]

### Tenant ID

>[!TIP]
>**Applies to:** ![Applies to.](../../media/yes.png)Service principal ![Does not apply to.](../../media/no.png)Master user

To get the tenant ID GUID, follow these steps:

1. Log into [Microsoft Azure](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#allservices).

2. Search for **App registrations** and select the **App registrations** link.

3. Select the Azure AD app you're using for embedding your Power BI content.

4. From the **Overview** section, copy the **Directory (tenant) ID** GUID.

### Power BI username and password

>[!TIP]
>**Applies to:** ![Does not apply to.](../../media/no.png)Service principal ![Applies to.](../../media/yes.png)Master user

Obtain the *username* and *password* of the Power BI user you're using as your **master user**. This is the same user you used to create a workspace and upload a report to, in Power BI service.

## Step 6 - Service principal API access

>[!TIP]
>**Applies to:** ![Applies to.](../../media/yes.png)Service principal ![Does not apply to.](../../media/no.png)Master user
>
>This step is only relevant if you're using the *service principal* authentication method. If you're using a *master user*, skip this step and continue with [Step 7 - Enable workspace access](#step-7---enable-workspace-access).

For an Azure AD app to be able to access the Power BI content and APIs, a Power BI admin needs to enable service principal access in the Power BI admin portal. If you're not the admin of your tenant, get the tenant's admin to enable the *Tenant settings* for you.

1. In *Power BI service*, select **Settings** > **Settings** > **Admin portal**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/embed-sample-for-customers/admin-settings.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the admin settings menu option in the Power B I service settings menu.":::

2. Select **Tenant settings** and then scroll down to the **Developer settings** section.

3. Expand **Allow service principals to use Power BI APIs**, and enable this option.

    :::image type="content" source="media/embed-sample-for-customers/developer-settings.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to enable the developer settings option, in the tenant settings menu option, in Power B I service.":::

>[!NOTE]
>When using a *service principal*, it's recommended to limit its access to the tenant settings using a *security group*. To learn more about this feature, see these sections in the [service principal](embed-service-principal.md) article:
>
> * [Create an Azure AD security group](embed-service-principal.md#step-2---create-an-azure-ad-security-group)
> * [Enable the Power BI service admin settings](embed-service-principal.md#step-3---enable-the-power-bi-service-admin-settings)

## Step 7 - Enable workspace access

To enable your Azure AD app access objects such as reports, dashboards and semantic models in the Power BI service, add the *service principal* or *master user*, as a *member* or *admin* to your workspace.

1. Sign in to Power BI service.

2. Scroll to the workspace you want to enable access for, and from the **More** menu, select **Workspace access**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/embed-service-principal/workspace-access.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the workspace access button in the more menu of a Power B I workspace.":::

3. In the **Access** pane, depending on which authentication method you're using, copy the *service principal* or *master user* to the **Enter email address** text box.

    >[!NOTE]
    >If you're using a *service principal*, its name is the name you gave your Azure AD app.

4. Select **Add**.

## Step 8 - Embed your content

The Power BI embedded sample application allows you to create an *embed for your customers* Power BI app.
