> [!TIP]
> You can also use the [Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app](/fabric/enterprise/metrics-app) to monitor your capacity.

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-resource-types](~/../reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-resource-types.md)]

For more information about the resource types for Power BI Embedded, see [Power BI Embedded monitoring data reference](monitor-power-bi-embedded-reference.md).

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-platform-metrics](~/../reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-platform-metrics.md)]

For a list of available metrics for Power BI Embedded, see [Power BI Embedded monitoring data reference](monitor-power-bi-embedded-reference.md#metrics).

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-custom-metrics](~/../reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-non-monitor-metrics.md)]

You can use the [Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app](/fabric/enterprise/metrics-app) to monitor your capacity.

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-resource-logs](~/../reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-resource-logs.md)]

For the available resource log categories, their associated Log Analytics tables, and the log schemas for Power BI Embedded, see [Power BI Embedded monitoring data reference](monitor-power-bi-embedded-reference.md#resource-logs).

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-activity-log](~/../reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-activity-log.md)]

Although platform metrics and the Azure Monitor activity log are collected and stored automatically, you can route them to other locations by using diagnostic settings. Diagnostic settings define where resource logs and metrics for a particular resource should be sent.

Resource logs aren't collected and stored until you create at least one diagnostic setting and route it to a location. When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of resource logs to collect. The categories for Power BI Embedded are listed in the [Power BI Embedded monitoring data reference](monitor-power-bi-embedded-reference.md#resource-logs).

For more information about how to create and configure diagnostic settings by using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell, see [Diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-settings).

Here's an example of a query that completes in less than five minutes (300,000 milliseconds):

```kusto
    search *
    | where Type == "AzureDiagnostics"
    | where ( OperationName == "QueryEnd" )
    | where toint(Duration_s) < 300000   
```

### Power BI Embedded alert rules

You can set alerts for any metric, log entry, or activity log entry listed in the [Power BI Embedded monitoring data reference](monitor-power-bi-embedded-reference.md).
