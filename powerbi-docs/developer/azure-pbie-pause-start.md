# Pause and start your Power BI Embedded capacity in the Azure portal

This article walks through how to pause and start a Power BI Embedded capacity in Microsoft Azure. This assumes you have created a Power BI Embedded capacity. If you have not, see [Create Power BI Embedded capacity in the Azure portal](azure-pbie-create-capacity.md) to get started.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Pause your capacity

Pausing your capacity prevents you from being billed. Pausing your capacity is great if you do not need to use the capacity for a period of time. Use the following steps to pause your capacity.

> [!NOTE]
> Pausing a capacity may prevent content from being available within Power BI. Make sure to unassign workspaces from your capacity before pausing to prevent interruption.

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2. Select **All services** > **Power BI Embedded** to see your capacities.

3. Select the capacity you want to pause.

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2. Select **All services** > **Power BI Embedded** to see your capacities.

If any content is assigned to this capacity, it is available once started.
