# What is custom visual development?

You can use custom visuals in Power BI to create a unique type of visual that’s tailored to you, or the data insights you’re trying to convey. Often these custom visuals are created by developers, and they are often created when the multitude of visuals that are included in Power BI don’t quite meet their need.
In some organizations, custom visuals are even more important – they might be necessary to convey specific data or insights unique to the organization, they may have special data requirements, or they may highlight private business methods. Such organizations need to develop custom visuals, share them throughout their organization, and make sure they’re properly maintained. Power BI custom visuals let organizations do just that.

We’re enabling developers to easily add custom visuals into Power BI for use in dashboard and reports. To help you get started, we’ve published the code for all of our visualizations to GitHub. Along with the visualization framework, we’ve provided our test suite and tools to help the community build high-quality custom visuals for Power BI. All of this is available as an open-source project on GitHub.
