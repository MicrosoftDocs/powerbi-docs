# Tutorial: Embed a Power BI report, dashboard or tile into an application for your customers
With **Power BI Embedded in Azure**, you can embed reports, dashboards, or tiles into an application using **app owns data**. **App owns data** is about having an application that uses Power BI as its embedded analytics platform. This is typically an **ISV developer** scenario. As an **ISV developer**, you can create Power BI content that displays reports, dashboards, or tiles in an application that is fully integrated and interactive, without requiring users of the application to have a Power BI license, or even be aware that it’s Power BI under the hood. This tutorial demonstrates how to integrate a report into an application using the **Power BI** .NET SDK along with the **Power BI** JavaScript API when using **Power BI Embedded in Azure** for your customers using **app owns data**.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:
>[!div class="checklist"]
>* Register an application in Azure.
>* Embed a Power BI report into an application.

## Prerequisites
To get started, you need a **Power BI Pro** account which will be your **master account** and a **Microsoft Azure** subscription.

* If you're not signed up for **Power BI Pro**, [sign up for a free trial](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/) before you begin.
* If you don’t have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
* You need to have your own [Azure Active Directory tenant ](create-an-azure-active-directory-tenant.md) setup.
* You need [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) installed (version 2013 or later).

## Setup your embedded analytics development environment

Before you start embedding reports, dashboard, or tiles into your application, you need to make sure your environment is set up to allow for embedding. As part of the setup, you will need to do the following.

You can go through the [Onboarding experience tool](https://aka.ms/embedsetup/AppOwnsData) to quickly get started and download a sample application that helps you walk through creating an evnironment and embedding a report.

However, if you choose to set up the environment manually, you can continue below.
### Register an application in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)

You register your application with Azure Active Directory to allow your application access to the Power BI REST APIs. This allows you to establish an identity for your application and specify permissions to Power BI REST resources.

1. Accept the [Microsoft Power BI API Terms](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/api-terms).

2. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
 
    ![Azure Portal Main](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-002.png)

3. In the left-hand navigation pane, choose **All Services**, select **App Registrations** and then select **New application registration**.
   
    ![App registration search](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-003.png)</br>
    ![New App registration](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-004.png)

4. Follow the prompts and create a new application. For apps owns data you need to use **Native** for the application type. You also need to provide a **Redirect URI**, which **Azure AD** uses to return token responses. Enter a value specific to your application (for example: http://localhost:13526/redirect).

    ![Create App](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-005.png)

### Apply permissions to your application within Azure Active Directory

You will need to enable additional permissions for your application in addition to what was provided on the app registration page. You need to be logged in with the *master* account, used for embedding, which needs to be a global admin account.

### Use the Azure Active Directory portal

1. Browse to [App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ApplicationsListBlade) within the Azure portal and select the app that you are using for embedding.
   
    ![Choosing App](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-006.png)

2. Select **Settings**, then under **API Access** select **Required permissions**.
   
    ![Required Permissions](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-008.png)

3. Select **Windows Azure Active Directory** and then make sure **Access the directory as the signed-in user** is selected. Select **Save**.
   
    ![Windows Azure AD Permissions](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-011.png)

4. Select **Add**.

    ![Add Permissions](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-012.png)

5. Select **Select an API**.

    ![Add API Access](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-013.png)

6. Select **Power BI Service**, then select **Select**.

    ![Select PBI Services](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-014.png)

7. Select all permissions under **Delegated Permissions**. You can quickly select all **Delegated Permissions** by clicking the square next to the **Delegated Permissions** column header, or you can select them one by one. Select **Save** when done.
   
    ![Select delegated permissions](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-015.png)
    
    >[!Note]
    >Granting some permissions will require an Admin approval.  These are denoted by a column labeled **Requires Admin** with a green circle marked *Yes*.

8. Within **Required permissions**, select **Grant Permissions**.
   
    The **Grant Permissions** action is needed for the *master account* to avoid being prompted for consent by Azure AD. If the account performing this action is a Global Admin, you will grant permissions to all users within your organization for this application. If the account performing this action is the *master account* and is not a Global Admin, you will grant permissions only to the *master account* for this application.
   
    ![Grant permissions within required permissions dialog](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-016.png)

## Setup your Power BI environment

### Create an app workspace

If you are embedding reports, dashboards, or tiles for your customers, then you have to place your content within an app workspace. The *master* account must be an admin of the app workspace.

1. Start by creating the workspace. Select **workspaces** > **Create app workspace**. This will be the place to put content that your application needs to access.

    ![Create Workspace](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-020.png)

2. Give the workspace a name. If the corresponding **Workspace ID** isn't available, edit it to come up with a unique ID. This will be the name of the app, too.

    ![Name Workspace](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-021.png)

3. You have a few options to set. If you choose **Public**, anyone in your organization can see what’s in the workspace. **Private**, on the other hand, means only members of the workspace can see its contents.

    ![Private/Public](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-022.png)

    You can't change the Public/Private setting after you've created the group.

4. You can also choose if members can **edit** or have **view-only** access.

    ![Adding Members](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-023.png)

5. Add email addresses of people you want to have access to the workspace, and select **Add**. You can’t add group aliases, just individuals.

6. Decide whether each person is a member or an admin. Admins can edit the workspace itself, including adding other members. Members can edit the content in the workspace, unless they have view-only access. Both admins and members can publish the app.

Now you can view the new workspace. Power BI creates the workspace and opens it. It appears in the list of workspaces you’re a member of. Because you’re an admin, you can select the ellipsis (…) to go back and make changes to it, adding new members or changing their permissions.

   ![New workspace](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-025.png)

### Create and publish your reports

You can create your reports and datasets using Power BI Desktop and then publish those reports to an app workspace. The end user publishing the reports need to have a Power BI Pro license in order to publish to an app workspace.

1. Download the sample [Blog Demo](https://github.com/Microsoft/powerbi-desktop-samples) from GitHub.

    ![report sample](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-026-1.png)

2. Open sample PBIX report in **Power BI Desktop**

   ![PBI desktop report](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-027.png)

3. Publish to the **app workspace**

   ![PBI desktop report](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-028.png)

    Now you can view the report in the Power BI service online

   ![PBI desktop report](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-029.png)

## Embed your content

Embedding for your customers within your application requires you to get an **access token** for your master account from **Azure AD**. It is required to [get an Azure AD access token](get-azuread-access-token.md#access-token-for-non-power-bi-users-app-owns-data) for your Power BI application using app owns data before you make calls to the Power BI API.

Follow these steps to start embedding your content using a sample application.

1. Download the [App Owns Data sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-Developer-Samples) from GitHub to get started.

    ![App Owns Data application sample](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-026.png)

2. Open up the Web.config file in the sample application. There are 5 fields you will need to fill in to run the application successfully. The **clientID**, the **groupId**, the **reportId**, the **pbiUsername** and the **pbiPassword**.

      ![Web Config file](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-030.png)

    * Fill in the **clientId** information with the **Application ID** from **Azure**. The **clientId** is used by the application to identify itself to the users from which you're requesting permissions. To get the **clientId** follow these steps:

    1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

        ![Azure Portal Main](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-002.png)

    2. In the left-hand navigation pane, choose **All Services** and select **App Registrations**.

        ![App registration search](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-003.png)
    3. Select the application that you want to get the **clientId** for.

        ![Choosing App](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-006.png)

    4. You should see an **Application ID** that is listed as a GUID. Use this **Application ID** as the **clientId** for the application.

        ![clientId](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-007.png)     

    * Fill in the **groupId** information with the **app workspace GUID** from Power BI.

        ![groupId](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-031.png)

    * Fill in the **reportId** information with the **report GUID** from Power BI.

        ![reportId](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-032.png)    

    * Fill in the **pbiUsername** with the master user Power BI account.
    * Fill in the **pbiPassword** with the password for the master user Power BI account.

3. Run the application!

    First select **Run** in **Visual Studio**.

    ![Run the application](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-033.png)

    Then select **Embed Report**. Depending on which content you choose to test with - reports, dashboards or tiles - then select that option in the application.

    ![Select a content](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-034.png)
 
    Now you can view the report in the sample application.

    ![View application](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-035.png)

## Move to production

Now that your done developing your application, it is time to back your app workspace with dedicated capacity. Dedicated capacity is required to move to production.

### Create a dedicated capacity
By creating a dedicated capacity you can take advantage of having a dedicated resource for your customer. For workspaces that are not assigned to a dedicated capacity, these will be in a shared capacity. You can create a dedicated capacity using the [Power BI Embedded dedicated capacity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/power-bi-embedded/create-capacity) solution in Azure.

>[!Note]
>Embed tokens with PRO licenses are intended for development testing, so the number of embed tokens a Power BI master account can generate is limited. You must purchase a dedicated capacity for embedding in a production environment. There is no limit on how many embed tokens you can generate with a dedicated capacity. Go to [Available Features](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/power-bi/availablefeaturesx) to check the usage value that indicates the current embedded usage in percentage.
>

### Assign app workspace to dedicated capacity

Once dedicated capacity is created, assign the app workspace to the dedicated capacity. To complete this, follow these steps.

1. Within the **Power BI service**, expand workspaces and select the ellipsis for the workspace your embedding your content with. Then select **Edit workspaces**.

    ![Edit Workspace](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-036.png)

2. Expand **Advanced**, then enable **Dedicated capacity**, then select the dedicated capacity you created. Then select **Save**.

    ![Assign dedicated capacity](media/embed-sample-for-customers/embed-sample-for-customers-024.png)
