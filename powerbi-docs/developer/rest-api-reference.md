# Power BI REST API Reference

Power BI is a cloud-based service that you can use to build custom dashboard applications. The Power BI REST API is a REST-based API that provides programmatic access to all the artifacts the service is using, such as:
* Datasets
* Dashboards
* Reports
* Gateways

[!INCLUDE [GDPR-related guidance](../includes/gdpr-hybrid-note.md)]

The Power BI REST API has the following operations:

* Dataset operations: Get and create Datasets.
* Table operations: Get Tables and update Table schema.
* Row operations: Add Rows and Delete Rows.
* Group operations: Get Groups.
