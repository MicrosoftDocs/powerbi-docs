# Power BI REST API Reference
Power BI is a cloud-based service that you can use to build custom dashboard applications. The Power BI REST API is a REST-based API that provides programmatic access to **Dashboard** resources such as **Datasets**, **Tables**, and **Rows** in Power BI.

The Power BI REST API has the following operations:

* Dataset operations: Get and create Datasets.
* Table operations: Get Tables and update Table schema.
* Row operations: Add Rows and Delete Rows.
* Group operations: Get Groups.

To learn more about the Power BI REST API, see [Overview of Power BI REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn877544.aspx).
