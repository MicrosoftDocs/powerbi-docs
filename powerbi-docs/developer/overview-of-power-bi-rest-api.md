# What can developers do with the Power BI API?
Power BI displays dashboards that are interactive, and can be created and updated from many different data sources in real time. Using any programming language that supports REST calls, you can create apps that integrate with a Power BI dashboard in real-time. You can also integrate Power BI tiles and reports into apps.

Developers can also build their own data visualizations that can be used in interactive reports and dashboards. 

Here are some of the things you can do with the Power BI APIs.

| **To do this** | **Go here** |

| Extend an existing business workflow to push key data into a Power BI dashboard. |[Push data into a dashboard](walkthrough-push-data.md) |
| Import a Power BI Desktop file |[Import PBIX File](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt243837.aspx) |
| Authenticate to Power BI. |[Authenticate to Power BI](get-azuread-access-token.md) |
| Create a custom visual. |[Use developer tools to create custom visuals](../service-custom-visuals-getting-started-with-developer-tools.md) |

> [!NOTE]
> The Power BI APIs still refer to app workspaces as groups. Any references to groups mean that you are working with app workspaces.
