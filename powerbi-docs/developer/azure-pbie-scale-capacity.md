# Scale your Power BI Embedded capacity in the Azure portal

This article walks through how to scale a Power BI Embedded capacity in Microsoft Azure. Scaling allows you to increase or decrease the size of your capacity.

This assumes you have created a Power BI Embedded capacity. If you have not, see [Create Power BI Embedded capacity in the Azure portal](azure-pbie-create-capacity.md) to get started.

> [!NOTE]
> A scaling operation can take about a minute. During this time, the capacity will not be available. Embedded content may fail to load.

## Scale a capacity

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2. Select **All services** > **Power BI Embedded** to see your capacities.

3. Select the capacity you want to scale.

4. Select **Pricing tier** under **Scale** within your capacity.

    Your current pricing tier is outlined in blue.

5. To scale up or down, select the new tier to move to. Selecting a new tier places a dashed blue outline around the selection. Select **Select** to scale to the new tier.

    Scaling your capacity may take a minute or two to complete.

6. Confirm your tier by viewing the overview tab. The current pricing tier is listed.
