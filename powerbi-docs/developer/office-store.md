# Publish custom visuals to AppSource

Learn how you can publish your custom visual to AppSource for others to discover and use.

Once you have created your custom visual, you may want to publish it AppSource for others to discover and use. There is some preparation that needs to be done before you can do that. For more information on how to create a custom visual, see Developing a [Power BI Custom Visual](custom-visual-develop-tutorial.md).

## What is AppSource?

The **AppSource** is the place to find SaaS apps and add-ins for your Microsoft products and service. [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps?product=power-bi-visuals) connects millions of users of Office 365, Dynamics 365, Cortana Intelligence, and others, to solutions that help them get work done more efficiently, more insightfully or more beautifully than before.

## Preparing to submit your custom visual

Once you're done coding and testing your custom visual and have packaged it into a pbiviz file, you should also have the following ready for your submission.

| Sample .pbix report file |Yes |To showcase your visual, you should help users to get acquainted with the visual. You should emphasize on the value the visual brings to the user and give examples of usage, formatting options, etc. You can also add a *"hints"* page at the end with some tips and tricks, things to avoid and the like.<br>The sample .pbix report file must work offline, without any external connection |

## Submitting to Power BI

Submission starts with sending an email to the Power BI custom visuals submission team. You can email [pbivizsubmit@microsoft.com](mailto:pbivizsubmit@microsoft.com).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must fill the following fields in the pbiviz.json file: “description”, “supportUrl”, “author“, “name” and “email” before you create the .pbiviz package.

Attach the **.pbiviz file** and the **sample report .pbix file** in your email. The Power BI team will reply back with instructions and an app package XML file to upload. This XML app package is required in order to submit your visual through the Office developer center.

> [!NOTE]
> To improve quality and assure that existing reports are not breaking, updates to existing visuals will take an additional two weeks to reach production environment after approval in the store.

## Submitting to AppSource

Once you get the app package XML from the Power BI team, navigate to the [developer center](https://sellerdashboard.microsoft.com/Application/Summary) to submit your visual to AppSource.

> [!NOTE]
> You must have a valid Office developer account to log in to the [Office developer center](https://dev.office.com/). An Office developer account must be a Microsoft Account (Live ID, e.g. hotmail.com or outlook.com).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must send an email with the .pbiviz file and the .pbix file to the Power BI team before submitting to AppSource. This allows the Power BI team to upload the files to the public share server. Otherwise, the store will not be able to retrieve the files. You must send the files with each new visual submission, update to existing visual, and fixes to rejected submissions.

## Tracking submission status and usage

You can review the [validation policies](https://dev.office.com/officestore/docs/validation-policies#13-power-bi-custom-visuals).
