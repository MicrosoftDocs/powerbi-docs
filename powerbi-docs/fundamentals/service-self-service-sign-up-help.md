# What to do if sign up is disabled

You've tried to sign up for Power BI and received a message that sign up is disabled. For a variety of reasons, some organizations block members from self-service sign up.  For example, your organization may have a policy that all licenses and subscriptions are managed by a centralized IT department, even free licenses. 


**Self-service sign up is disabled**    
You attempt to sign up and receive a message similar to this: 

*We can't finish signing you up. Your IT department has turned off sign up for Microsoft Power BI. Contact them to complete signup.* 

**Solution**    
Self-service sign up for Power BI has been disabled. To finish signing up, contact your IT department or help desk and ask them to [follow these instructions to enable sign up](../admin/service-admin-disable-self-service.md). 

You may also experience this problem if you signed up for Microsoft 365 through a partner. In which case, contact the organization responsible for providing you with Microsoft 365.
