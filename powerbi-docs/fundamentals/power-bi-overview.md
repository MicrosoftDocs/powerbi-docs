# What is Power BI

Power BI is Microsoft's business analytics platform that helps you turn data into actionable insights. Whether you're a business user, report creator, or developer, Power BI offers integrated tools and services to connect, visualize, and share data across your organization.

In this article, you'll learn:

- What Power BI is and how it fits with Microsoft Fabric
- The key differences between Power BI Desktop and Power BI service
- How to get started with Power BI step-by-step
- Which Power BI component to use for your specific needs

Power BI is a core component of Microsoft Fabric, providing analytics and visualization capabilities. In Fabric, Power BI shares features like data integration, dataflows, and security with other Fabric experiences. However, some features - such as Power BI reports, dashboards, and the Power BI service - are unique to Power BI.

## Power BI and Microsoft Fabric

[Microsoft Fabric](/fabric/get-started/microsoft-fabric-overview) is an all-in-one analytics platform that includes Power BI as one of its core workloads. If you're a Power BI user, here's what you need to know.

**Key points**:

- No migration needed - your Power BI content and workspaces remain unchanged.
- Use your existing Power BI or Microsoft 365 account to sign in.
- Fabric adds new capabilities, but Power BI’s interface and experience remain familiar.

The following table summarizes the key features of Power BI and how they compare to Microsoft Fabric:
