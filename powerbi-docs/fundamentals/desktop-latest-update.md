> [!NOTE]
> Some resources use earlier versions of Power BI Desktop or the Power BI service.

Download previous versions of Power BI Desktop if your organization requires it. We recommend using the most recent version of Power BI Desktop instead of a previous version. Previous versions have these limitations:

- Previous releases of Power BI Desktop aren't serviced—always use the most recent release for the latest features and updates.
- You can't open files created or saved in newer releases of Power BI Desktop with previous versions.
- If you get a warning when loading a report saved in a newer release, then save that report in the previous version, you lose any information related to new features.
- Only the English versions of Power BI Desktop are archived.

> **Download** the [August 2025 version of Power BI Desktop](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=58494&dlm=002&frame=0&nav=1&msockid=033bf3dd086965063115e683097e64d0).
