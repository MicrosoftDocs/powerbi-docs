# What's new in Power BI Desktop?

## June 2020 Update (2.82.5858.301)

Our June Power BI Desktop feels like a fresh new beginning filled with new capabilities, generally available features, and many opportunities to get out into your world of data and interact. 

Get the latest version of Power BI Desktop from the [Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=58494). If you're running Windows 10, you can also get Power BI Desktop from the [Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/pbidesktopstore). Regardless of how you install Power BI Desktop, the monthly versions are the same, although the version numbering may differ. For more information about downloading and installing Power BI Desktop, see [Get Power BI Desktop](desktop-get-the-desktop.md). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Beginning with the September 2019 release, Power BI Desktop is released only as a single .exe file, which contains all supported languages. The .msi version is no longer being released.
