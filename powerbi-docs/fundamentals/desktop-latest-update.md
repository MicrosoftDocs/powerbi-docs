If you're running Windows 10, you can also get Power BI Desktop from the [Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/pbidesktopstore). Regardless of how you install Power BI Desktop, the monthly versions are the same, although the version numbering may differ. For more information about downloading and installing Power BI Desktop, see [Get Power BI Desktop](desktop-get-the-desktop.md).
