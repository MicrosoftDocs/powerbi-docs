Download previous versions of Power BI Desktop if your organization requires it. We recommend using the most recent version of Power BI Desktop instead of a previous version. Previous versions have these limitations:

- Previous releases of Power BI Desktop aren't servicedâ€”always use the most recent release for the latest features and updates.
- You can't open files created or saved in newer releases of Power BI Desktop with previous versions.
- If you get a warning when loading a report saved in a newer release, then save that report in the previous version, you lose any information related to new features.
