# Sign up for or purchase the Power BI service as an individual

***Power BI service*** can be your personal data analysis and visualization tool, and can also serve as the analytics and decision engine behind group projects, divisions, or entire corporations. This article explains two ways individuals can get a license for the Power BI service for themselves. 

If you're a global administrator or billing administrator, see [Power BI licensing for your organization](../enterprise/service-admin-licensing-organization.md). To download the free Power BI Desktop, see [Get Power BI Desktop](desktop-get-the-desktop.md).

This quickstart takes you through the steps to sign up for Power BI from a *Try now* or *Buy now* link, from an email link, and how to upgrade your per user license from an in-product link. For an in-depth review of the many other ways to sign up or purchase Power BI, see [Sign up and purchase Power BI as an individual](service-self-service-signup-purchase-for-power-bi.md)

## Prerequisites

To complete this quickstart, you need: 

- an understanding of the [license and subscription options for Power BI and Fabric.](/fabric/enterprise/licenses)

- an understanding of [how Power BI and Fabric work together](../enterprise/service-admin-licensing-organization.md)

- A work or school email address that can be used with Power BI and Fabric. Commercial accounts, such as Google and Hotmail, can't be used.  

## Supported email addresses

Before you start the self-service process, it's important to understand which types of email addresses you can use to sign up for or purchase Power BI.

Power BI requires that you use a work or school email address. You can't sign up or purchase using email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunication providers. These services include `outlook.com`, `hotmail.com`, `gmail.com`, and others. If you don't have a work or school account, [learn about alternate ways to sign up](../enterprise/service-admin-signing-up-for-power-bi-with-a-new-office-365-trial.md).

You can sign up for or purchase Power BI with .gov or .mil addresses, but this approach requires a different process. For more information, see [Enroll your US Government organization in the Power BI service](../enterprise/service-govus-signup.md).

## Sign up to get a per-user license for Fabric and Power BI

Follow these steps to sign up for per-user license for the Power BI service. The license options are Fabric (Free), Pro, PPU (Premium Per User), or trial. This section covers the sign-up process for a free license. With a free license you can try the Power BI service on your own using My Workspace, consume content from a Power BI workspace assigned to a Power BI Premium capacity, and initiate an individual Fabric trial. For more information, see [Power BI features by license type](service-features-license-type.md).

The exact steps for sign-up vary depending on your organization and what you select to start the process. There are many different ways to sign up for the Power BI service as an individual, and the steps in this article apply to three of the most common.

- Select a **Try free** or **Start free** button. Find these types of buttons on `powerbi.microsoft.com`, in related Microsoft products, and in documentation and marketing articles.
- Receive an email with a link to a Power BI dashboard, report, or app. And, clicking the link is your first time signing in to this Power BI account.
- Receive an in-product link to upgrade or try the paid version of PPU or Pro.

### Select a button to purchase or try Power BI

There are many different buttons that Microsoft publishes for new Power BI users. Some of these buttons are **Try free**, **Buy now**, and **Start a free trial**. In this example, we select a **Start free** button. 

1. Select **Start free** from [powerbi.microsoft.com](https://powerbi.com).

   ![Screenshot of Power BI service showing powerbi.microsoft.com in a web browser.](media/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi/power-bi-try-free.png)

1. When prompted, sign in using your organizational account.

1. In this example, Microsoft 365 recognizes you and knows that you already have at least one other Microsoft service installed. You're assigned a free license.  

    :::image type="content" source="media/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi/power-bi-free.png" alt-text="Screenshot of screen confirming Fabric (Free) license assigned to you.":::

    Because you are a new user, Power BI opens your Home screen. Home contains resources to help you get started. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi/power-bi-home.png" alt-text="Screenshot of your Power BI Home screen.":::

1. You might even receive popups with suggestions to get started. Here is one example. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi/power-bi-help-popup.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a popup help screen.":::

1. Confirm your new license. Open your Account manager by selecting the circle from the upper right corner. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi/power-bi-account-manager.png" alt-text="Screenshot of your Power BI Account manager with your icon and license type outlined in red.":::

You now have a Fabric (Free) license to work in Power BI and to explore the free features of all of the Fabric workloads. If a Fabric free license is sufficient, you don't have to do anything else. 
- If you find that you need more than a Fabric (Free) license to work in the Power BI service, the last section of this article explains how to upgrade to a Pro or PPU license. 
- If you find that you need more than a Fabric (Free) license to work in Fabric, see [Trial of a Fabric capacity](/fabric/get-started/fabric-trial.md)

There's [plenty to do in the Power BI service with a free license](../consumer/end-user-license.md), especially if Power BI creators share their content with you in [Premium capacity.](../enterprise/service-premium-what-is.md) 

### Get a license by selecting an email link


Customers typically start a trial one of two ways:

- As you start to explore the Power BI service or any of the other services in Fabric, you try to use a feature that requires a paid license or a Fabric capacity. Fabric automatically initiates the Fabric trial. [Some features of the Power BI service require a Pro or PPU license](../consumer/end-user-license.md).  

    ![Screenshot of Power BI service showing Power BI trial dialog.](media/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi/power-bi-full-trial.png)

- Trials can also be initiated from your Account manager. Open your Account manager by selecting the tiny photo in the upper right corner.  

    :::image type="content" source="media/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi/power-bi-me.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing an Account manager and the Start trial button.":::

    :::image type="content" source="media/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi/power-bi-trial.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the dialog to select Start trial.":::

The trial license upgrades you with a Microsoft Fabric trial capacity. Create and work with any Fabric item types and access the paid features of the Power BI service. 

:::image type="content" source="media/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi/power-bi-fabric-home.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Fabric Home screen.":::

For more information about trials, see [Fabric trial](/fabric/get-started/fabric-trial)

### Trial expiration

You can cancel your trial from the Account manager. If you cancel your trial, you might not be able to start another trial. 

When you cancel your Fabric trial, or your trial expires, the trial capacity is deleted. This deletion includes deletion of all of the capacity's [workspaces](/fabric/get-started/workspaces) and related data. To migrate your workspaces and data, [purchase a Fabric capacity](/fabric/enterprise/buy-subscription).  

When your trial expires, or you cancel your trial, your license changes back to its previous version, either Fabric free, Pro, or PPU. The trial can't be automatically extended. For more information, see [Features by license type](service-features-license-type.md). 

If you'd like to cancel your trial before the expiration date, select your account icon and choose **Cancel trial**.

:::image type="content" source="media/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi/power-bi-cancel-trial.png" alt-text="Screenshot of your account screen with Cancel trial selected.":::

## Use self-service purchase to buy an individual Power BI license

You can use self-service to buy Power BI Pro from the Power BI website or from in-product purchase prompts. 

:::image type="content" source="media/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi/power-bi-buy-pro.png" alt-text="Screenshot of your Account manager with a red arrow pointing to Buy Pro now.":::

You're first asked to enter an email address to ensure that your email address is already associated with at least one other Microsoft online service. If you're recognized by Microsoft, you're next directed to sign in. After you sign in, you're asked to select how many subscriptions you want to buy, and to provide credit card payment. When the purchase is complete, you can start using your subscription. You also have access to a limited view of the Microsoft 365 admin center where you can assign licenses for the product to other people in their organization.

If your email is not recognized, you can start with a Fabric free trial instead. For instructions, see [Sign up for Power BI with a free trial](../enterprise/service-admin-signing-up-for-power-bi-with-a-new-office-365-trial.md) or see [Sign up for a free Fabric trial](/fabric/get-started/fabric-trial).

If you have more questions about self-service purchase, visit the [Self-service purchase FAQ](/microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/self-service-purchase-faq).

To purchase a Power BI Pro license, select **Buy now** when prompted, or visit [Power BI pricing](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/pricing). Self-service purchase is also available for Power BI Premium Per User, and the steps are similar.

If self-service purchase isn't available, contact your administrator about purchasing a Power BI Pro license.

### Start with a Power BI Pro trial

Another way to buy Power BI Pro is to sign up for a trial of Power BI Pro. After the trial ends, your credit card it charged. The following steps and screens apply to users signing up for Pro and who don't have a work or school email address. Instead, you create an @onmicrosoft.com account which is used to buy Power BI Pro. 

1. Go to [Power BI Pro signup](https://signup.microsoft.com/create-account/signup?OfferId=d59682f3-3e3b-4686-9c00-7c7c1c736085&ali=1&products=d59682f3-3e3b-4686-9c00-7c7c1c736085) and enter an email address. Select **Next**.

     :::image type="content" source="../media/service-admin-get-started-email.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the get started window.":::

1. The email address you entered is evaluated. Select **Set up account** or **Change my email** to enter a different address.

   > [!NOTE]
   >If your email address is already in use with another Microsoft service, you can **Sign in** or **Create a new account instead**. If you choose to create a new account, continue to the next step.

1. Complete the **Tell us about yourself** form and select **Next**. The country/region selected determines where your data is stored. For more information, see [Find the default region for your organization](../admin/service-admin-where-is-my-tenant-located.md#find-the-default-region-for-your-organization). The country/region doesn't have to match your physical location, but should match the location for most of your users.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/service-admin-tell-us-dialog.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the tell us about yourself window.":::

1. Select whether you want to receive a verification code by text or call. Enter a phone number. Select **Send verification code**.

1. Enter the verification code, and then select **Verify**.

1. Complete the **How you'll sign in** form. This step creates your user ID and password to sign in to your account. You can change the pre-filled username and domain. Domain name is validated to ensure that it isn't a duplicate. Once validated, the domain name is used to create your organization in the datacenter as a subdomain of `onmicrosoft.com`. Create and confirm a password. Select **Next**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/business-identity-dialog.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the window for creating the onmicrosoft.com subdomain.":::

Review the confirmation details. The account you created is now the global admin of a new Power BI Pro trial tenant. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) to add more users, set up a custom domain, purchase more services, and manage your Power BI subscription.

## Considerations and limitations

In most cases, you can sign up for the Power BI service and for Fabric by following the described processes. Some of the issues that might prevent you from signing up are described here, with possible workarounds.

### Can't access your Fabric items

- If you're using a Power BI Premium capacity, Microsoft Fabric items aren't supported. To enable support for Microsoft Fabric items on your Power BI capacity, [enable Microsoft Fabric](/fabric/admin/fabric-switch).

- If you're using Microsoft 365, certain versions include a free Fabric license and a free or paid Power BI license. For example, the E5 SKU includes a Fabric free license (but no capacity) and a Power BI Pro license. Without a trial or purchased capacity, you might not be able to access your Fabric items. To learn how to look up your user license, see [what license do I have?](../consumer/end-user-license.md)

### Personal email addresses

**Personal email addresses**
 You attempted to sign up using a personal email address (for example nancy@gmail.com) and you received a prompt similar to one of these messages. 

*You entered a personal email address: Enter your work email address so we can securely store your company's data*.

*That looks like a personal email address. Enter your work address so we can connect you with others in your company. And don't worry. We don't share your address with anyone*.

The Power BI service doesn't support email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunications providers. To finish signing up, try again using an email address assigned by your work or school. 

If signup still doesn't work, try a more advanced setup process.  [Register for a new Microsoft 365 trial subscription and use that email address to sign up.](../enterprise/service-admin-signing-up-for-power-bi-with-a-new-office-365-trial.md)

You can also have an existing user [invite you as a guest](../enterprise/service-admin-azure-ad-b2b.md).

[!INCLUDE[self-service-signup](../includes/self-service-signup-help.md)]

### Your email address isn't a Microsoft 365 ID

You attempt to sign up or purchase and receive a message like this:

*We can't find you at contoso.com. Do you use a different ID at work or school? Try signing in with that ID. If it doesn't work, contact your IT department.*

Your organization uses IDs that are different than your email address to sign in to Microsoft 365 and other Microsoft services. For example, your email address might be `zalan.bola@contoso.com` but your ID is `zalanb@contoso.com`.

To finish signing up or purchasing, use the ID that your organization assigned to you for signing in to Microsoft 365 or other Microsoft services. If you don't know what this ID is, contact your global administrator.  

If you still can't sign up or purchase there is a more advanced setup process available. [Register for a new Microsoft 365 trial subscription and use that email address to sign up](../enterprise/service-admin-signing-up-for-power-bi-with-a-new-office-365-trial.md).

### Sign-in doesn't recognize your password

Sometimes it takes a few tries. If you retry your password several times and you still can't sign in, try running your browser in Incognito (Chrome) or InPrivate (Microsoft Edge) mode.

### You don't receive in-product prompts

You don't see prompts to upgrade (Buy now) or start a trial (Try now), and the UI doesn't display **Try now** or **Buy now** buttons.

The type of upgrade and trial options that you're offered depends on how your administrator set up your domain. Your administrators have the ability to disable all trials, disable self-service purchase, and more.
