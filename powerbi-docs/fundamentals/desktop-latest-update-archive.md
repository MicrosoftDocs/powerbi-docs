You can also download previous versions of Power BI Desktop if your organization requires it. We always recommend that you use the most recent version of Power BI Desktop, rather than a previous version. All previous versions have the following limitations:

* Previous releases of Power BI Desktop are not being serviced - you should always use the most recent release for the latest features and updates.
* It might not be possible to open files created or saved in newer releases of Power BI Desktop with previous versions of Power BI Desktop. 
* If you receive a warning when loading a report saved in a newer release of Power BI Desktop, then save that report in the previous version, you lose any information related to new features.
* We only archive the English versions of Power BI Desktop.

Our December updates made sugar plums dance in our customers' heads, or at least created compelling data-driven visuals of said sugar plums. 

You can now [download the latest version of Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop). If you're running Windows 10, you can also get **Power BI Desktop** from the Windows Store.

See [this article](desktop-get-the-desktop.md) for more information. 

The links beside each update mean the following:

* **[video]** excerpts play in a new browser tab, when the feature is being discussed.
* Some features have an **[article]** that provides more detail.
* Most features are explained in the monthly update **[blog]** post.
* Lastly, some features are self-explanatory and don't need an article or video.

You can also watch the **Latest Updates** video from the beginning, right inside this article, by clicking on the **play** icon on the video image found below the list of updates.
