# Power BI Desktop Send a Smile privacy statement

Error reporting uses the Windows Error Reporting platform rather than the *Send a Smile* or *Send a Frown* functionality. You can get more information about the Windows Error Reporting platform in the [Windows Privacy blog](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/01/24/microsoft-introduces-new-privacy-tools-ahead-of-data-privacy-day/).
