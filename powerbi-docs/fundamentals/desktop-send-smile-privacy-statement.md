# Power BI Desktop Send a Smile privacy statement

Error reporting uses the Windows Error Reporting platform rather than the *Send a Smile* or *Send a Frown* functionality. You can get more information about the Windows Error Reporting platform in the [Windows Privacy blog](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/01/24/microsoft-introduces-new-privacy-tools-ahead-of-data-privacy-day/).

## For versions of Power BI Desktop prior to March 2018

At Microsoft, we work hard to protect your privacy while delivering products that bring you the performance, power, and convenience you want. This privacy statement explains many of the data collection and use practices of Microsoft Power BI Desktop Feedback *Send a Smile*. It doesn’t apply to other online or offline Microsoft sites, products, or services.

*Send a Smile* doesn’t send personal information to Microsoft, except for the instances described in this statement. Information that is sent to Microsoft isn’t shared outside of Microsoft and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your permission.

*Send a Smile* for Power BI Desktop allows you to send an email address with your feedback. This email address is used to contact you if Microsoft needs further information or clarification on your request. You don’t have to register your email address with Microsoft to use *Send a Smile*.

*Send a Smile* for Power BI Desktop allows you to send feedback to Microsoft and, if you want, include screenshots showing the specific compliment or concern you have. Although *Send a Smile* doesn’t intentionally collect personal data, it's possible that such information might be captured in the feedback or screenshots you provide.

- Power BI Desktop program usage, such as File Package Info (Document Locale, Fast Combine Enabled/Disabled state), Enabled and Disabled Preview Features, DirectQuery vs. Import mode, current Working Set, and Peak Virtual Memory used in the current session.

- Feedback you provide about the product or service you're using.
- To provide critical updates and notifications regarding the software.
- To improve the product or service—for example, bug and survey form inquiries.

- Processing event registration.
- Performing statistical analysis of our services.

We provide those companies with only the personal information they need to deliver the service, and they're prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

- Comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal process.
- Protect the rights or property of Microsoft or our customers, including the enforcement of our agreements or policies governing your use of the services.
- Act on a good faith belief that such access or disclosure is necessary to protect the personal safety of Microsoft employees, customers, or the public.
