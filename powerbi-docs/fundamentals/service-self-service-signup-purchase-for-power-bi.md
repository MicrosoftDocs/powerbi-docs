# Sign up or purchase Power BI as an individual

This article explains how individuals in an organization can sign up for or purchase Power BI when self-service is enabled, so they can analyze data and create visualizations **when self-service is enabled for their account by their organization**.

These *self-service* methods include upgrading to a paid license, starting individual trials, and getting free licenses if your organization allows self-service. If the term self-service is new to you, or if you're an administrator who manages self-service, visit these admin articles [What is self-service?](/microsoft-365/admin/misc/self-service-sign-up) and [Self-service for Microsoft 365 products and services.](/microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/manage-self-service-purchases-admins).

If you're unable to sign up for Power BI or to purchase a Power BI individual license, it might be because your Microsoft 365 Billing administrator disabled self-service options. Ask them to [enable self-service sign-up and self-service-purchase.](../enterprise/service-admin-licensing-organization.md#enable-and-disable-self-service-sign-up-and-purchase)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Signing up for the Power BI service requires a work or school email account. Consumer email accounts (for example, gmail or hotmail) can't be used.  
>
> If you don't see a way to sign up or start a trial, common reasons are:
>
> - Your organization’s administrator disabled self-service sign-up or purchase.
> - You're using a personal/consumer email account instead of a work or school account.
> - You already have a license (so “Start free” or “Start trial” prompts no longer appear).
> - Trial eligibility was already used on your account.
> For detailed troubleshooting, see the [self-service licensing and trial FAQ](service-self-service-sign-up-help.md).

## Quickstart: Get a license in a few minutes

Use one of these fast paths to obtain an initial individual license (typically Fabric [Free]) or start an upgrade. Later sections cover additional trial and purchase variations.

| Option | How to Start | Steps | Outcome |
|--------|--------------|-------|---------|
| **Published button** | Go to the [Power BI website](https://powerbi.com) and select **Start free** (may appear as **Try free**, **Start a free trial**, or **Buy now**) | 1. Sign in with your work or school account.<br>2. If recognized, you are assigned a Fabric (Free) license and land on **Home**. | Assigned Fabric (Free) license |
| **Shared link in email** | Open the email and select the shared dashboard, report, or app link | 1. First-time access triggers license evaluation.<br>2. A free (or sometimes paid) license is assigned depending on organizational settings. | License assigned based on org settings |
| **In-product upgrade prompt** | While on a Fabric (Free) license, select a feature that requires a paid license | - In the prompt choose **Start trial** or **Buy now**. | Start trial or purchase license |
| **Account manager** | Select your profile (account manager) in the upper-right corner | 1. Review **License type**.<br>2. Select **Buy now** or **Start trial** (if shown). | Start trial or purchase license |

If a Fabric (Free) license meets your needs, you can work in **My workspace** and consume content in Premium capacity. Otherwise, continue with the trial or purchase sections below.

### Why you might not see sign-up or trial options

You may not be able to sign up individually if:

- Self-service sign-up or purchase is disabled by an administrator.
- You’re signed in with a personal (consumer) email account.
- You already hold an applicable license (the “Start free” or “Start trial” prompts are suppressed).
- Your prior trial period ended and isn’t extendable.

> [!NOTE]
> For deeper troubleshooting (blocked sign-up, trial prompts not showing, capacity vs PPU, license capability differences) see the [self-service licensing and trial FAQ](service-self-service-sign-up-help.md).

## Look up your current license or trial

You might already have a Power BI license or trial. To look up your license type, see [licenses and trials](end-user-license.md#find-out-which-licenses-you-have).

For example, your organization might provide you with Microsoft 365. Some versions of Office 365 include Power BI Pro licenses.

### Sign-up options

#### [Free sign-up](#tab/free-sign-up)

## Sign up for a free license

If your organization purchased a Power BI subscription and self-service is enabled for your account, you can sign up by:

1. Opening Power BI in a browser (app.powerbi.com).
1. Selecting a **Try for free** type of button.
1. Selecting a Power BI link in an email. Colleagues share Power BI items in email. If you never opened Power BI before, selecting one of these links initiates signing up for a license.

    :::image type="content" source="media/service-self-service-signup-purchase-for-power-bi/power-bi-email.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an email that contains a Power BI link.":::

All of these actions sign you up for a per-user license and open the Power BI service in a browser. The type of license assigned to you depends on your organization's subscription and self-service settings. To learn more about the types of licenses, see [Power BI license types](end-user-license.md).

If the Power BI service doesn't open or if you receive an error message, your organization might not have a Power BI subscription **or self-service might be disabled**. See [Email validation](#email-validation) and, if self-service is disabled, contact your administrator to request a license.

### Email validation

The first time you attempt to sign up for a license, Microsoft asks for your email address.

If your organization didn't purchase Power BI, you're redirected to a sign-up process. This alternate sign-up process creates an account and possibly even creates a new tenant.

For more information about creating a Microsoft account, see [How to check if your email address is a Microsoft account](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/how-to-check-if-your-email-address-is-a-microsoft-account-b3ba5b92-5ead-4a28-adc9-b40558bb697e)

#### [Individual trial](#tab/trial)

## Start a trial

Microsoft offers a few different trials that assign you a Power BI license. You can sign up for a trial of the paid version of Power BI, sign up for a trial of Microsoft 365, or sign up for a trial of a Fabric capacity.

### Start a Power BI individual user trial

If you already have a Fabric (Free) license and try to use a feature that requires a paid license, Power BI displays upgrade prompts. Depending on your organization's subscription and self-service settings, you might receive prompts to join a trial or to make an upgrade purchase, or both.

:::image type="content" source="media/service-self-service-signup-purchase-for-power-bi/fabric-prompt.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a dialog prompting upgrade to a paid Power BI license.":::

### Start a trial of a Fabric capacity

Another way to start a trial of a paid Power BI license is to [start a trial of a Fabric capacity](/fabric/get-started/fabric-trial). The trial includes a license similar to Power BI Premium Per User (PPU). Open your Account manager and select **Start trial.**

:::image type="content" source="media/service-self-service-signup-purchase-for-power-bi/power-bi-account-manager.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Account manager showing Start trial.":::

### Start a Microsoft 365 trial of Pro

If you don't have a work or school email account, you can still start a trial of Power BI Pro or Fabric (Free). [Sign up for a trial of Microsoft Office 365 E5](../enterprise/service-admin-signing-up-for-power-bi-with-a-new-office-365-trial.md) and create an *onmicrosoft* email account and a new tenant. The Microsoft 365 trial includes up to 25 licenses and you become the admin for the new tenant. The E5 version of Microsoft Office 365 includes a Pro license. A credit card is required to sign up, so be sure to cancel the trial before 30 days if you aren't ready to purchase.  

For more information about the Microsoft 365 trial, see [sign up for Power BI with a Microsoft 365 trial.](../enterprise/service-admin-signing-up-for-power-bi-with-a-new-office-365-trial.md)

#### [Purchase](#tab/purchase)

### Buy a license

There are many ways for an individual to buy a license. Three are described here. Use in-product prompts, your Account manager, or the [Microsoft Power BI pricing site](https://www.microsoft.com/power-platform/products/power-bi/pricing).

#### Buy a license using an in-product prompt
 
If you already have a license and try to use a Power BI feature that requires a paid license, Power BI displays upgrade prompts. Depending on the self-service options that your organization enabled, you might receive prompts to join a trial, or to make an upgrade purchase, or both.

:::image type="content" source="media/service-self-service-signup-purchase-for-power-bi/fabric-prompt.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a dialog with a message to upgrade to a paid Power BI license.":::

#### Buy a license from the Account manager

Open your Account manager from the upper right corner. Select **Buy now**. You have access to your Account manager if you already have a Microsoft Fabric or Power BI license.

:::image type="content" source="media/service-self-service-signup-purchase-for-power-bi/fabric-pro-buy.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Account manager with Buy Pro now outlined in red.":::

#### Buy a license from a commercial site

You can also purchase Pro or PPU licenses from the [Microsoft Power BI pricing site](https://www.microsoft.com/power-platform/products/power-bi/pricing).

## Troubleshooting and blockers

Common blockers and next steps:

- Self-service sign-up or purchase disabled: Contact a Billing admin to request a license or enable self-service.
- Self-service upgrades disabled: Purchase directly (if permitted) via in-product prompt or pricing site; you receive a limited Microsoft 365 admin view to assign seats you buy.
- Internal process required: Follow your organization's custom request workflow rather than the standard flows shown here.
- No existing subscription for your domain: Email validation may route you through an alternate sign-up or tenant creation experience.
- Feature still prompts for upgrade after sign-in: Your current license is Fabric (Free) and the feature requires Pro or PPU (or PPU-only workspace access).

For a broader Q&A set, see the [self-service licensing and trial FAQ](service-self-service-sign-up-help.md).

## Close your account, cancel your subscription, end your trial

You can always cancel your free subscription, cancel a purchase, or end your trial. Each of these actions has a different set of procedures and considerations. For more information, see [Close your account, cancel your subscription, end your trial](/fabric/enterprise/fabric-close-end-cancel).
