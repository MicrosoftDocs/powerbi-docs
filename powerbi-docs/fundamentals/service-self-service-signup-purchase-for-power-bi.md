# Sign up or purchase Power BI and Fabric as an individual

This article explains how individuals can get a license for Microsoft Fabric. 

There are two ways for individuals to get a license. You can sign up for or purchase a license for yourself. This includes getting a free or paid license that an admin makes available for users in an organization. The other method is for an admin to assign you a license. This article explains the first option, which is called **self-service**. If the term *self-service* is new to you, visit [Self-service for Microsoft 365 products and services](/microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/manage-self-service-purchases-admins) or [What is self-service](/microsoft-365/admin/misc/self-service-sign-up).

If you are unable to sign up or to purchase Fabric, self-service options might be disabled by your administrator. Contact your administrator and ask them to [enable self-service sign-up and self-service-purchase.](../enterprise/service-admin-licensing-organization.md#enable-and-disable-self-service-sign-up-and-purchase)

## Prerequisites

This quickstart expects that you know the following information:

- The [difference between Microsoft Fabric and the Power BI service](/power-bi/fundamentals/power-bi-overview#how-microsoft-fabric-works-with-power-bi)
- The [licenses and capacities for Fabric and Power BI](/fabric/enterprise/licenses). 
- The [license and trials](../consumer/end-user-license.md#find-out-which-licenses-you-have) you already have.
- The definitions of [self-service sign-up and self-service purchase](/microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/manage-self-service-purchases-admins). 
- How self-service setting work with the [Users can try Microsoft Fabric paid features](../admin/service-admin-portal-help-support#users-can-try-microsoft-fabric-paid-features) setting.
- The type of email account that you have. [It must be a work or school account.](../enterprise/service-admin-signing-up-for-power-bi-with-a-new-office-365-trial.md)  

## Licenses and capacities

Both the Power BI service and Fabric require all users to have access to a Fabric or Power BI capacity and to have a per-user license. The license options are Fabric (Free), Power BI Pro, or Premium Per User (PPU). 

## Fabric licensing and capacities

A Fabric (Free) license is the minimum license that you need to work in all of the Fabric workloads. However, you do also need a capacity to save your Fabric items. Use self-service to get the licenses and capacities that you need. To learn about subscriptions, visit [Buy subscriptions](/fabric/buy-subscription).  

#### [Free sign-ups and trials](#tab/free-sign-ups-and-trials)

### Activate a license for an organizational subscription

Your organization has purchased a Fabric or Power BI subscription that includes capacities and licenses. Self-service is enabled. Open Fabric in a browser (app.fabric.microsoft.com) to activate a license for yourself. The license you are assigned depends on the organizational subscription and self-service settings. 

If you've never used Fabric, you can activate your license by selecting an email link. Colleagues share Fabric items in email, and selecting a Fabric link initiates signing up for a Fabric license. 

Another way to activate your license is to select a **Try free** or **Buy now** button. 

### Sign up for a free Fabric license

Some organizations don't have Fabric (Free) licenses available for your use or have self-service disabled. Sign up for a free Fabric account on the [Pricing site.](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/pricing)

### Start a trial

Microsoft offers trials of licenses,  capacities, and subscriptions. 

#### Start a trial of a Fabric capacity

Start a [trial of a Fabric capacity](/fabric/get-started/fabric-trial). The trial includes a capacity and advanced permissions similar to a PPU license. The trial gives you access to all Fabric workloads and features and 1 TB of storage. 

Sign up at (app.fabric.microsoft.com) The individual who starts the trial becomes the Capacity administrator. The Capacity administrator can share the trial by adding workspaces to the Trial capacity. Users with access to the workspaces are now part of the Fabric trial too.

Open your Account manager from the upper right corner. Select **Start trial**. You have access to your Account manager if you already have a Fabric license.

#### Start a Power BI individual user trial

If you already have a free license and try to use an advanced Power BI feature, Fabric displays upgrade prompts. Depending on your configuration, you might receive prompts to join a trial or to make an upgrade purchase, or both.

#### Start a Microsoft 365 trial of Pro

If you don't have a work or school email account, you can still start a trial of Power BI Pro. To do this, [sign up for a trial of Microsoft 365 E5](../enterprise/service-admin-signing-up-for-power-bi-with-a-new-office-365-trial.md). This version of Microsoft 365 includes a Pro license. The Microsoft 365 trial includes up to 25 licenses. Your Microsoft 365 trial lasts for 30 days. After the trial ends your credit card is charged. You become the admin for the new domain. 

For more information about the Microsoft 365 trial, see [sign up for Power BI with a Microsoft 365 trial.](../enterprise/service-admin-signing-up-for-power-bi-with-a-new-office-365-trial.md)

[A Fabric capacity subscription](/fabric/enterprise/buy-subscription.md) includes a capacity and per-user licenses. There are a range of options available split into Stock Keeping Units (SKUs). Buying  subscriptions is an admin function. 

## Close your account, cancel your subscription, end your trial

You always have the option to close your account, cancel your subscription, or end your trial. Each of these actions has a different set of procedures and considerations. For more information, see [Close your account, cancel your subscription, end your trial](/fabric/enterprise/fabric-close-end-cancel)

## Considerations and troubleshooting

- If you have a subscription for Microsoft 365 E5, you have a Pro license. 
- You can sign up for or purchase Power BI with .gov or .mil addresses, but this approach requires a different process. For more information, see [Enroll your US Government organization in the Power BI service](../enterprise/service-govus-signup.md).
- If you're unable to use self-service to get your own Power BI license, check to see if your administrator disabled this option. The admins who manage the domain can disable self-service sign-ups, self-service purchases, upgrades, and free trials. For help when you can't use self-service, go to [Self-service sign up and purchase help](service-self-service-sign-up-help.md).

- If you're an admin, [learn how to enable and disable self-service.](../enterprise/service-admin-disable-self-service.md)

- Direct purchase or an upgrade to Pro or Premium Per User isn't available to educational organizations or organizations deployed to Azure Government or Azure China 21Vianet clouds.

- This article describes the self-service process for the **Power BI service** and **Fabric**. If you're looking for help with downloading Power BI Desktop or with installing the mobile apps, refer to these articles:

    - [Power BI Desktop (free download)](desktop-get-the-desktop.md)
    - [Power BI mobile apps (free download)](../consumer/mobile/mobile-apps-for-mobile-devices.md)

- If you're part of an organization and used self-service to purchase Power BI, the Global or Billing admin for your organization can [**takeover** ownership](/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/domains-admin-takeover) of your subscription, and then assign or unassign licenses.
