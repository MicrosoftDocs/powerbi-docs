# Sign up or purchase Power BI as an individual

This article explains how individuals within an organization can sign up for Power BI or purchase Power BI for themselves. 

These *self-service* methods include buying a paid license, starting individual trials, and getting free licenses if your organization allows self-service. If the term self-service is new to you, or if you're an administrator who manages self-service, visit these admin articles [What is self-service?](/microsoft-365/admin/misc/self-service-sign-up) and [Self-service for Microsoft 365 products and services.](/microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/manage-self-service-purchases-admins).

If you're unable to sign up for Power BI or to purchase Power BI, it might be because your Microsoft 365 Global administrator disabled self-service options. Ask them to [enable self-service sign-up and self-service-purchase.](../enterprise/service-admin-licensing-organization.md#enable-and-disable-self-service-sign-up-and-purchase)

## Look up your current license or trial

You may already have a Power BI license or trial. To learn more, see [licenses and trials](../consumer/end-user-license.md#find-out-which-licenses-you-have) to learn how to look it up.

#### [Free sign-up](#tab/free-sign-up)

## Sign up for a free license

Your organization purchased a Power BI subscription that includes licenses. Self-service is enabled. Sign up by:
1. Opening Power BI in a browser (app.powerbi.com).
1. Selecting a **Try for free** type of button. 
1. Selecting a Power BI link in an email. Colleagues share Power BI items in email. If you've never opened Power BI before, selecting one of these links initiates signing up for a license. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/service-self-service-signup-purchase-for-power-bi/power-bi-email.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an email that contains a Power BI link.":::

All of these actions sign you up for a per-user license and open the Power BI service in a browser. The license you're assigned depends on your organization's subscription and self-service settings. To learn more about the types of licenses, see [Power BI license types](xxx).

If the Power BI service doesn't open or if you receive an error message, it's possible that your organization hasn't purchased a Power BI subscription. See [Email validation](#email-validation) to learn what steps to take to get a per-user license.

### Email validation

The first time you attempt to sign up for a license, Microsoft asks for your email address. 

If your organization didn't purchase Power BI, you are redirected to a sign up process. You're asked to create an account and possibly even create a new tenant. For more information on this process, see [xxx.](xxx)

#### [Individual trial](#tab/trial)

## Start a trial

Microsoft offers a few different trials that assign you a Power BI license. You can sign up for a trial of the paid version of Power BI, sign up for a trial of Microsoft 365, or sign up for a trial of a Fabric capacity. 

### Start a Power BI individual user trial

If you already have a Fabric (Free) license and try to use a feature that requires a paid license, Power BI displays upgrade prompts. Depending on your organization's subscription and self-service settings, you might receive prompts to join a trial or to make an upgrade purchase, or both.

### Start a trial of a Fabric capacity

Another way to start a trial of a paid Power BI license is to [start a trial of a Fabric capacity](/fabric/get-started/fabric-trial.md). The trial includes a license similar to Power BI Premium Per User (PPU). Open your Account manager and select **Start trial.**

:::image type="content" source="media/service-self-service-signup-purchase-for-power-bi/power-bi-account-manager.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Account manager showing Start trial.":::

### Start a Microsoft 365 trial of Pro

If you don't have a work or school email account, you can still start a trial of Power BI Pro or Fabric (Free). You can do this by [signing up for a trial of Microsoft Office 365 E5](../enterprise/service-admin-signing-up-for-power-bi-with-a-new-office-365-trial.md) and creating an *onmicrosoft* email account and a new tenant. The Microsoft 365 trial includes up to 25 licenses and you become the admin for the new tenant. The E5 version of Microsoft Office 365 includes a Pro license. A credit card is required to sign up, so be sure to cancel the trial before 30 days if you aren't ready to purchase.  

For more information about the Microsoft 365 trial, see [sign up for Power BI with a Microsoft 365 trial.](../enterprise/service-admin-signing-up-for-power-bi-with-a-new-office-365-trial.md) 

#### [Purchase](#tab/purchase)

### Buy a license

There are many ways for an individual to buy a license. Three are described here. Use in-product prompts, your Account manager, or the [Microsoft Power BI pricing site](https://www.microsoft.com/power-platform/products/power-bi/pricing).

#### Buy a license using an in-product prompt
 
If you already have a license and try to use a Power BI feature that requires a paid license, Power BI displays upgrade prompts. Depending on the self-service options that your organization enabled, you might receive prompts to join a trial, or to make an upgrade purchase, or both. 

:::image type="content" source="media/service-self-service-signup-purchase-for-power-bi/fabric-prompt.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing dialog with message to Upgrade to a paid Power BI license.":::

#### Buy a license from the Account manager

Open your Account manager from the upper right corner. Select **Buy now**. You have access to your Account manager if you already have a Microsoft Fabric or Power BI license.

:::image type="content" source="media/service-self-service-signup-purchase-for-power-bi/fabric-pro-buy.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Account manager with Buy Pro now outlined in red."::: 

#### Buy a license from a commercial site

You can also purchase Pro or PPU licenses from the [Microsoft Power BI pricing site](https://www.microsoft.com/power-platform/products/power-bi/pricing).

## Close your account, cancel your subscription, end your trial

You can always cancel your free subscription, cancel a purchase, or end your trial. Each of these actions has a different set of procedures and considerations. For more information, see [Close your account, cancel your subscription, end your trial](/fabric/enterprise/fabric-close-end-cancel).

## Considerations and troubleshooting

- If you have a subscription for Microsoft 365 E5, you have a Pro license. 
- You can sign up for or purchase Power BI with .gov or .mil addresses, but this approach requires a different process. For more information, see [Enroll your US Government organization in the Power BI service](../enterprise/service-govus-signup.md).
- If you're unable to use self-service to get your own Power BI license, check to see if your Microsoft 365 Global administrator disabled the self-service options. Also check with the Fabric administrator to see if they changed the upgrade and trial options available to you. For help when you can't use self-service, go to [Self-service sign up and purchase help](service-self-service-sign-up-help.md).

- If you're an admin, [learn how to enable and disable self-service.](../enterprise/service-admin-disable-self-service.md)

- Self-service purchase of Pro and PPU licenses isn't available to educational organizations or organizations deployed to Azure Government or Azure China 21Vianet clouds.

- This article describes the self-service process for the **Power BI service.** If you're looking for help with downloading Power BI Desktop or with installing the mobile apps, refer to these articles:

- [Power BI Desktop (free download)](desktop-get-the-desktop.md)
- [Power BI mobile apps (free download)](../consumer/mobile/mobile-apps-for-mobile-devices.md)

- If you're part of an organization and used self-service to purchase Power BI, the Global or Billing admin for your organization can [**take over** ownership](/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/domains-admin-takeover) of your subscription, and then assign or unassign licenses.
