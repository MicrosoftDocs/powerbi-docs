- Conceptual videos that explain things like: terminology, the logic behind how something works, and foundational information
- Video *series* that are combined into a course or certification
- Recordings of past Community webinars
- Customer success stories
- Videos from conferences (Ignite, Data Insights, and more) that we've hosted
- Monthly product update videos that describe and show new features
