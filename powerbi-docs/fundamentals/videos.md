# Power BI videos

You'll find Power BI videos embedded in our documentation, organized into channels and playlists on YouTube, and in the Community video gallery. Our videos come in many different flavors:
- How-to videos that teach you how to *do something* in Power BI
- Conceptual videos that explain things like: terminology, the logic behind how something works, and foundational information
- Video *series* that are combined into a course or certification
- Community webinars that we've hosted in the past
- Customer success stories
- Videos from conferences (Ignite, Data Insights, and more) that we've hosted 
- Monthly product update videos that describe and show new features



> [!NOTE]  
  > Videos might use earlier versions of Power BI Desktop or the Power BI service.
