# Supported browsers for Power BI

Power BI is designed to work with any of these supported browsers; howerver, performance differs depending on your choice of a browser. If you're using Internet Explorer, you may encounter worse performance. We strongly recommend to switch from Internet Explorer to a modern browser, including Microsoft Edge. If you still encounter unacceptable performance, test other supported modern browsers to see if they provide better results for your Power BI solution.

Power BI supports these browsers on all platforms where they're available:

- Microsoft Edge
- Internet Explorer 11. Some advanced features, such as lineage view, aren't supported in Internet Explorer. See [Data lineage (preview)](../collaborate-share/service-data-lineage.md) for details.
- Chrome desktop latest version
- Safari Mac latest version
- Firefox desktop latest version. Firefox may change the fonts used in Power BI 

> [!NOTE]
> Power BI doesn't run in any browsers in iOS10 or previous versions.
