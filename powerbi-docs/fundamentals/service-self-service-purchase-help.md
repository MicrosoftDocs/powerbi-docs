# What to do if purchasing Power BI Pro is disabled

You've tried to purchase Power BI Pro and received a message that your organization doesn't allow its users to do this. For a variety of reasons, some organizations block members from self-service purchase of Power BI Pro.  For example, your organization might have a policy that all licenses and subscriptions are managed by a centralized IT department or help desk.

## Solution
To finish your purchase, contact your IT department or help desk and ask them to [follow these instructions to provide you with a license](../enterprise/service-admin-manage-licenses.md).
