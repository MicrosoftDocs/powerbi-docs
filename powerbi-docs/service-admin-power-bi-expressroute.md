# Power BI and ExpressRoute

**ExpressRoute** is an Azure service that lets you create private connections between Azure datacenters (where Power BI resides) and your on-premises infrastructure, or create private connections between Azure datacenters and your colocation environment.

With **Power BI** and **ExpressRoute**, you can create a private network connection from your organization to Power BI (or using an ISPâ€™s colocation facility), bypassing the Internet to better secure your sensitive Power BI data and connections.

For more information, see [ExpressRoute overview](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction). Power BI is compliant with ExpressRoute, with some exceptions, where Power BI gets or sends data over the public Internet. For a list of the URLs that Power BI uses, see [Power BI URLs](power-bi-whitelist-urls.md).
