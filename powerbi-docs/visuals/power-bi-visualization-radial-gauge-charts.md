# Radial gauge charts in Power BI

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-yes-desktop-yes-service.md)]

A radial gauge chart uses a circular arc to show how a single value progresses toward a goal or a Key Performance Indicator (KPI). The gauge line (or _needle_) represents the goal or target value. The shading represents the progress toward the goal. The value inside the arc represents the progress value. Power BI spreads all possible values evenly along the arc, from the minimum (left-most value) to the maximum (right-most value).

The following example shows a radial gauge chart for tracking car sales.

:::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-visualization-radial-gauge-charts/sample-gauge-chart.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a radial gauge chart in Power BI.":::

In this example, a car retailer is tracking the sales team's average sales per month. The gauge needle represents the sales goal of 140 cars sold. The minimum sales average is zero and the maximum is 200. The blue shading shows that the team is averaging approximately 120 sales this month. They have one more week to reach the goal.

## When to use a radial gauge

Radial gauges are a great choice in many scenarios:

- Show progress toward a goal.

- Represent a percentile measure, like a KPI.

- Show the health of a single measure.

- Display information that's easy to scan and understand.

## Prerequisites

If you want to share your report with a colleague, you both need to have individual Power BI Pro licenses. If both of you don't have individual Power BI Pro licenses, you need to save the report to a workspace in a Premium capacity to enable sharing. For more information, see [sharing reports](../collaborate-share/service-share-reports.md).

## Download the sample data

To follow along with the procedure, download the Financial Sample Excel file. Then you can open it either in Power BI Desktop or in the Power BI service. See the article [Download the Financial Sample Excel workbook for Power BI](../create-reports/sample-financial-download.md) for details. 




## Create a gauge chart

Let's begin by creating a simple radial gauge chart in Power BI. We can track gross sales by using data from the Financial Sample Excel file.

# [Power BI Desktop](#tab/powerbi-desktop)

1. In Power BI Desktop, select **File** > **Open report**.

1. Browse to and select the **Financial Sample Excel** file, and then select **Open**.

   The **Financial Sample Excel** file opens in report view. :::image type="icon" source="media/power-bi-visualization-kpi/power-bi-report-view.png":::

1. At the bottom, select the green plus symbol :::image type="icon" source="media/power-bi-visualization-kpi/power-bi-plus-green-tab.png"::: to add a new page to the report.

# [Power BI service](#tab/powerbi-service)

1. Open the Financial Sample Excel file in Excel, and on the **File** menu, select **Publish** > **Publish to Power BI**.

1. Select **Export workbook data to Power BI**.

1. You may need to sign in to the Power BI service (`app.powerbi.com`). Select **Go to Power BI**.

    The Power BI service opens in Edit mode with a blank page and the Financials data in the Data pane.

4. In the **Data** pane, expand **financials** and select the **Gross Sales** checkbox.

   By default, Power BI creates a clustered column chart to display the data. On the **Visualizations** > **Build visual** pane, the **Y-axis** option is aligned to the **Gross Sales** value. Notice that by default, Power BI uses the _sum_ value for the selected field.

   :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-visualization-radial-gauge-charts/power-bi-sum.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the default cluster column chart for the selected data field.":::

1. On the **Visualizations** pane, open the drop-down menu for the **Gross Sales** value under the **Y-axis** option and select **Average**.

   This action changes the aggregation for the chart to use the average of gross sales rather than the sum.

   :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-visualization-radial-gauge-charts/power-bi-average.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to change the aggregation view for the chart to use the average of the gross sales values.":::

   You can convert the clustered column chart visual into a gauge chart.

1. Select the chart visual, and then select **Gauge** on the **Visualizations** pane.

   Notice the changes to the **Visualizations** pane. The **Average of Gross Sales** value is now listed under the **Value** option. Several other value options are listed, including the **Minimum**, **Maximum**, and **Target**.

   By default, Power BI sets the current value (in this case, **Average of Gross Sales**) as the halfway point on the gauge. Because the **Average of Gross Sales** value is $184.21 K, the start point on the gauge (**Minimum value**) is set to 0. The end point on the gauge (**Maximum value**) is set to double the current value.

   :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-visualization-radial-gauge-charts/power-bi-gauge.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the initial gauge chart in Power BI that shows the average of gross sales as the gauge value.":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > Depending on when you download the Financial Sample Excel file, your chart might show different values.

## Add a target value 

You can modify the gauge chart to show a target value. This action creates a _needle_ on the gauge chart to identify the target.

1. On the **Data** pane, select and drag the **COGS** field to the **Target value** option on the **Visualizations** > **Build visual** pane.

   Power BI changes the chart view to show _Average of Gross Sales_ and _COGS_ (Sum).

1. On the **Visualizations** pane under the **Value** option, open the drop-down menu for the **Sum of COGS** value and select **Average**.

   By default, Power BI calculates the average of the two values _Gross Sales_ and _COGS_ to determine the target value. Power BI adds a needle to the gauge to represent the target.

   :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-visualization-radial-gauge-charts/power-bi-gauge-needle.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the updated gauge chart with a needle that represents the target value.":::

   Power BI calculates the target value as $146.65K. The position of the gauge needle shows that the average of the _Gross Sales_ and _COGS_ values exceeds the target.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can manually specify a target value rather than using the calculation from Power BI. For more information, see the [Use manual options to set values](#use-manual-options-to-set-values) section.

## Set a maximum value

Power BI uses the **Value** field on the **Visualizations** > **Build visual** pane to automatically set the minimum and maximum values for the gauge. You can rely on the calculations from Power BI or set your own values.

Let's see how you can set the maximum value to the highest gross sales number in your semantic model.

1. On the **Data** pane, select and drag the **Gross Sales** field to the **Maximum value** option on the **Visualizations** pane.

1. On the **Visualizations** pane under the **Maximum value** option, open the drop-down menu for the **Gross Sales** value and select **Maximum**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-visualization-radial-gauge-charts/power-bi-gauge-max.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to set the maximum value for the gauge chart.":::

   The gauge is redrawn with a new end value of 1.21 million in gross sales.

1. Save the report.

## Use manual options to set values

You can also use manual settings in Power BI to configure the maximum, minimum, and target values for your gauge chart.

1. On the **Visualizations** > **Build** visual pane, remove the **Max of Gross Sales** value from the **Maximum value** option.

1. Select the paint brush icon to open the **Format** visual section.

1. Expand the **Gauge axis** option and enter values for the **Min** and **Max** settings. In our example, we set the values to 100,000 and 250,000.

   :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-visualization-radial-gauge-charts/power-bi-min-max.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to format the minimum and maximum values for the gauge axis.":::

1. On the **Data** pane, clear the **COGS** checkbox to remove the target value.

   This action makes the **Gauge axis** > **Target** value on the **Format** pane available for configuration.

1. On the **Visualizations** > **Format** visual pane, enter a **Target** value for the **Gauge axis** option. In our example, we set the target value to 200,000.

1. Adjust other formatting option according to your preferences, such as the chart colors and labels, and then save the report.

When you're done, you have a gauge chart similar to the following example:

:::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-visualization-radial-gauge-charts/power-bi-gauge-chart-final.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a customized gauge chart in Power BI with a needle at the target value of 200,000.":::
