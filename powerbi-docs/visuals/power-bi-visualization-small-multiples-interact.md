# Interact with small multiples in Power BI

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-yes-desktop-yes-service.md)]

Small multiples, or trellising, split a visual into multiple versions of itself in Power BI. Learn how to interact with small multiples by selecting data points, scrolling through categories, cross-highlighting visuals, and sorting to analyze your data more effectively.

## Scroll in a small multiple

Small multiples may contain more individual charts that can fit in the grid. If so, you can scroll down to see the rest of your categories.

For a categorical X axis with many categories, you also see a scroll bar for each copy of that axis. Scrolling on that axis moves them all together. If you're using a scroll wheel, hold Shift to scroll the categorical axes.

## Select data to cross-highlight

You can select different subsets of data by selecting different parts of the visual.

### Select data points

Hover over the data point on one multiple to show the tooltip in that multiple. You also see a guide line on the X axis for line charts. Select that data point to cross-highlight other visuals by both the axis value and the small-multiple category, and dim the other multiples.

### Select a categorical axis value

Select a category label to cross-highlight other visuals by that axis value.

### Select a title

Select the title of a multiple to cross-highlight other visuals by the category in that subheader.

## Sort

With the sort functionality, you can sort multiple aspects of a visual at once. Sort by the category, and also by the axis in each multiple.
