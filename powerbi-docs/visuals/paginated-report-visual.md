# Create and use the paginated report visual

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-paginated-yes-service-yes-desktop](../includes/applies-yes-paginated-yes-service-yes-desktop.md)]

In this article, you learn how to use the paginated report visual for Power BI reports. This native Power BI visual allows you to render any paginated report you’ve uploaded to the service in a Power BI report.  

This visual brings the power of paginated reports to your Power BI reports. You can map fields from your Power BI dataset to be used as parameter values for your paginated report visual. The ability to map fields provides a fully interactive experience like any other visual.

The paginated report visual is designed to integrate a paginated report with other visuals in a Power BI report. It enables large data exports, detail drills, and generating documents. If you are migrating paginated report content from on premises, or find that the paginated report visual is the only element on a page, consider using the paginated report directly. 

## Prerequisites

For content with paginated report visuals, this table spells out the licenses and workspace permissions needed to publish, manage, and view the content.

|Type of capacity that hosts the workspace | License type to _publish and manage_ these reports in a workspace  |License type to _view_ these reports |
|---------|---------|---------|
|[Premium Per User (PPU)](../enterprise/service-premium-per-user-faq.yml) | A PPU license and write access to the workspace | Only users with PPU licenses  |
|[Power BI Premium](../enterprise/service-premium-gen2-what-is.md) | A PPU license or a [Power BI Pro license](../fundamentals/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi.md), and write access to the workspace | Users with free, Pro, and PPU licenses |

> [!NOTE]
> In a Premium Gen1 capacity, a Power BI admin needs to [enable paginated reports](../enterprise/service-admin-premium-workloads.md?tabs=gen1#paginated-reports) in the Premium capacities section of the Power BI admin portal. In a [Premium Gen2 capacity](../enterprise/service-premium-gen2-what-is.md#paginated-reports), paginated reports are enabled automatically.

## Create a paginated report visual

1. Open your Power BI report in Power BI Desktop or in the Power BI service. If in the Power BI service, select **Edit**. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/paginated-report-visual/paginated-report-visual-step-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting Edit in the Power BI service.":::

1. Select **Paginated Report** from the Visualizations pane.  

    :::image type="content" source="media/paginated-report-visual/paginated-report-visual-step-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting the Paginated report visual from the Visualizations pane.":::

1. Select **Connect to report**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/paginated-report-visual/paginated-report-visual-step-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Connect to report box.":::

1. Search for and select an existing paginated report saved to the Power BI service. 

1. Select **Set Parameters**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/paginated-report-visual/paginated-report-visual-step-4.png" alt-text="Screenshot of setting parameters.":::

1. You have two options for mapping paginated report parameters:  

    You can bind the paginated report parameter to Power BI fields:

    a. Drag your Power BI field into the Parameters field in the Visualizations pane.  
    b. Select this field from the dropdown menu. Select **See report**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/paginated-report-visual/paginated-report-visual-step-5-set-parameters.png" alt-text="Screenshot of binding a field in Power BI to a parameter in the paginated report visual.":::

    Or choose to use the default parameter for the paginated report, if the report author specified any.

    :::image type="content" source="media/paginated-report-visual/paginated-report-visual-step-5-default-parameters.png" alt-text="Screenshot of specifying parameters in the paginated report visual.":::

1. Now your paginated report will render within your Power BI report.  

    :::image type="content" source="media/paginated-report-visual/paginated-report-visual-step-6.png" alt-text="Screenshot of paginated report rendering in a Power BI report.":::

1. If making edits in the Power BI service, select **Save** to save your changes. If making edits in Power BI Desktop, select **Publish**, then choose a workspace in a Premium capacity to publish your Power BI report to the Power BI service.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > We recommend saving the Power BI report with the paginated report visual to the same workspace as the paginated report. This ensures that readers with access to the Power BI report also have access to the paginated report, which is required for the paginated report visual to render.

    :::image type="content" source="media/paginated-report-visual/paginated-report-visual-step-7.png" alt-text="Screenshot of publishing the report to the Power BI service.":::

## Cross-filtering

You can enable cross-filtering between your paginated report visual and other visuals in your Power BI report: Map your paginated report parameters to fields in the Power BI report. If you have other visuals that affect the Power BI field you’ve selected for the parameter values, the paginated report visual updates as you interact with those visuals.

For example, if you select Fiscal Year FY2018 in the slicer visual, the paginated report visual automatically updates to show sales for FY2018, because the Power BI field for Fiscal Year is mapped to the paginated report parameter for Fiscal Year.

## Turn on the toolbar

From the **Format** pane, you can show or hide the **Toolbar** in your paginated report visual. With the toolbar visible, report readers can easily export the paginated report from within the Power BI report using the paginated report **Export** toolbar button. Paginated reports support exporting to the following formats: Excel, PDF, Accessible PDF, CSV, PowerPoint, Word, MHTML, and XML. Standard Power BI report visuals impose a 150,000 row limitation when using the **Export data** option. In contrast, with the paginated report visual, you can export up to 1,000,000 rows to Excel using the **Export** button in the toolbar, and retain all the formatting in the paginated report.

:::image type="content" source="media/paginated-report-visual/paginated-report-visual-toolbar-export.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Export option on the paginated report toolbar.":::

You can also show parameters in the toolbar. In the **Format** pane, turn **Parameters** on. With this option enabled, you can select and apply parameters from the paginated report visual toolbar.

## Auto-apply filters

You can decide whether report filters are automatically applied to the paginated report visual, or not. By default, the Auto-apply filters option is turned off. With the option turned off, your paginated report visual remains unchanged as you adjust filters in your Power BI report. If you turn on Auto-apply filters, your paginated report visual automatically updates as you apply filters or update other visuals that affect the field you’ve selected for the parameter value.  

- Select your paginated report visual. From the **Format** pane, turn **Auto-apply filters** on.

## Considerations and limitations

- When connecting fields to a paginated report parameter, double-check whether the field values are used as is, in other words, **Don't summarize**, or as aggregates (for example, Sum, Average, and so on). You can use the **Show as a table** option from the context menu of the paginated report visual to see the actual values being passed to paginated reports during runtime. 
- You can map an aggregate field in Power BI such as Sum, Average, Minimum, or Maximum to a paginated report parameter. If you do, consider whether your paginated report parameter is a single-value or multi-value parameter. If mapping to a single-value parameter, the aggregate value is used. If mapping to a multi-value parameter, the per-row aggregate values are mapped to the parameter.
- When embedding a Power BI report that contains a paginated report visual, using the *embed for your customers* method, you need a service principal and a multi-resource embed token as explained in [How to embed a Power BI report that contains a paginated report visual](../developer/embedded/embedded-faq.yml#how-can-i-embed-a-power-bi-report-that-contains-a-paginated-report-visual-).
- The paginated report visual isn't supported for Power BI report subscription or export. You can open the underlying paginated report itself and create a subscription to it, as explained in [Subscribe to paginated reports](../consumer/end-user-subscribe.md?#subscribe-to-paginated-reports).
- The paginated report visual has a built-in 30,000-value data reduction limit. If any field used in the visual contains more than 30,000 values, a data reduction algorithm kicks in and drops the rows that are above the limit. As a result, the paginated report may show incorrect results due to missing data from report parameters. To work around this, try to use filters to filter out unnecessary values, or map the report parameters to fields with fewer values.
- The duration of the paginated report session is capped by the expiration time of your access token. Currently there's no support to automatically refresh the token. After the session expires, a dialog prompts you to refresh the visual and start a new rendering session.

### Using a Power BI dataset with a date parameter

> [!NOTE]
> Versions of Power BI Report Builder 15.7.01704.0001 and above allow you to use date parameters with the paginated report visual without having to follow these next steps. [Download the newest version of Power BI Report Builder](https://aka.ms/pbireportbuilder).

When you use a Power BI dataset as the data source for your paginated report and set up a date parameter in your query that then automatically generates the parameter table and parameter, using that parameter in a paginated report parameter will fail. The paginated report visually treats the parameter as a text field and fails to match the Power BI date field. You have three work-around options:

- From the same Power BI data source, create a new dataset with only the date values. Use this dataset as the available values for your parameter, setting the data type of the parameter as Date/Time.
- Manually change the DAX query text in the auto-generated dataset to remove the part that sets the parameter to be a text value.  
- Change the Power BI dataset using Power Query to add a column that formats the date field as a text field.
