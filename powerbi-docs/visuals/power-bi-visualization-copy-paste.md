# Copy and paste a report visualization
Visuals in Power BI reports can be copied from one page in the report to the same page or different page in the same report. 

Copying and pasting a visualization requires edit permissions to the report. In Power BI service, this means opening the report in [Editing View](../consumer/end-user-reading-view.md). Visualizations on dashboards cannot be copied and pasted.

## Copy and paste a visual

1. Open a report that has at least one visualization.  

2. Select the visualization and use **Ctrl +C** to copy, and **Ctrl +V** to paste.
