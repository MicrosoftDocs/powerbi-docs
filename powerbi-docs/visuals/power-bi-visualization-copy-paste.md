# Copy and paste a report visualization

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-yes-desktop-yes-service.md)]

In this article, we cover how to copy and paste a visual, a fundamental task that allows you to duplicate visuals within your reports. Reusing your visual elements and can help to ensure consistency across different parts of your report while avoiding the time and effort often needed to recreate visuals from scratch. This article provides step-by-step instructions, tips, and best practices to help you efficiently copy and paste visuals in Power BI.

## Copy a visual as a static image to your clipboard

These steps explain how to copy a static image of a visual in Power BI. Once copied, you can paste it into Microsoft OneNote, Word, Outlook, or any other application that supports pasting images.

#### In Power BI service, copy and paste a static image of a visual

When you copy a static image of a visual, the copied image displays whatever filters are applied to it along with its metadata including the following information:

- An **Open in Power BI** link to the Power BI report or dashboard.
- The title of the report or dashboard.
- A notice if the image contains confidential information.
- A time stamp indicating date and time of data in the static image of the visual.
- A text description of any filters applied to the static image of the visual.

Keep in mind that visuals can be copied from both Power BI dashboards and from Power BI reports.

#### [Dashboard](#tab/dashboard)

#### Copy from a dashboard tile

1. Open the Power BI service and navigate to the dashboard you want to copy from.

1. From the upper corner of the visual, select the ellipsis (**...**) to open a menu of options and choose **Copy visual as image**.

1. If your visual has a sensitivity label applied, you receive a warning before the copy is made. If the data shouldn't be shared with others, select **Cancel**. If you select **Copy**, the sensitivity label is added to the metadata under the pasted visual.

### Manage use of copying a visual as an image

If you're the content owner or administrator of the tenant, you can control whether a visual can be copied as an image from a report or dashboard.

#### Disable copy and paste for a specific visual

You can remove the copy icon from that visual in the Power BI service if you don't want users to be able to copy a specific visual. (Not available in Power BI Desktop).

1. Open the report in Editing mode.
1. Make the visual active by selecting it.
1. Select the paint brush icon to open the Formatting pane.
1. Select **General** > **Header icons** > **Icons** and expand the card.
1. Scroll down to the bottom of the card and toggle off **Copy icon**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-visualization-copy-paste/power-bi-headers.png" alt-text="Image of Power BI service highlighting location of 'Copy icon' selected.":::

1. If you can't find the **Visual header** setting, turn on the modern visual header option under **Report settings**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-visualization-copy-paste/power-bi-use-modern.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Enable modern visual header selected.":::

1. Save changes. Reshare and republish as needed.

#### Disable copy and paste for a group of users

If you own the content or are an administrator of the tenant, you can control who can copy visuals. This setting disables *copy as image with caption* in reports and *copy visual as image* on dashboards for all users of the Power BI tenant. Users might still see the copy and paste options but they receive an error message when they try to use them.
  
1. Navigate to the Admin Portal.

1. Under **Tenant settings**, locate **Export and sharing settings**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-visualization-copy-paste/power-bi-enable.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the 'Copy and paste visuals' toggle enabled.":::

1. Disable **Copy and paste visuals**, for your selected Security groups.
  
## Considerations and limitations

As a Power BI user, the awareness of any considerations and limitations when copying and pasting visuals is helpful whether you're a novice or an experienced user. Here's some practical information to consider:

**Q:** Why is the Copy icon inactive or grayed-out on a visual?<br>
**A:** The content owner or administrator of the tenant can turn off the copy feature for a visual which would make the Copy icon unavailable.

**Q:** Can I paste into any application?<br>
**A:** You can only paste into applications that support pasting images such as Word, PowerPoint, Outlook, or any application with support for pasting HTML.

**Q:** Why does the copied visual look different from the original?<br>
**A:** Formatted content, when copied to the clipboard, and pasted into another application might not render everything that was copied from the visual.

**Q:** Can I copy a visual from a Power BI dashboard, and paste it into a Power BI report or another dashboard?<br>
