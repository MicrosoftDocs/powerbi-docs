## Let's create (new) card visual

There are three similar ways to create a (new) Card visual:

- Start from the Insert ribbon, and select New visual, then select the (new) Card visual icon from the Visualizations pane, or
- Start from the Visualizations pane, and select the (new) Card visual icon, or lastly,
- Expand the Data pane, and select the necessary data fields, and then select the (new) Card visual icon from the Visualizations pane.  

For this quick three-step guide, let's use the first option:

1. In the **Insert** ribbon, select **New visual**. When the visual placeholder appears on the report canvas, expand the **Visualizations** pane and select the **(new) Card visual** icon in the **Build visual** menu.

2. To add data to the visual, let’s use the **Data pane** in this example. Adding data can be done by selecting each field in the **Data pane**, or dragging the fields to the field wells on the **Visualizations pane**, or dragging the fields directly to the visual placeholder in the report canvas. Expand the **Sales** group, to add **StoreCount**, then expand the **TotalSalesTY** subgroup, and add **Value**. You'll notice that each data field you add is displayed as its own card. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-visualization-new-card/build-new-card-desktop-step-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot: Data pane, Sales group expanded, StoreCount + TotalSalesTV measures highlighted, selected, and added to Data field in Visualizations pane." lightbox="media/power-bi-visualization-new-card/build-new-card-desktop-step-2.png":::

3. To customize your column chart, select the Format visual icon in the Visualizations pane, granting you access to all available settings. This allows you to tailor the chart's appearance and functionality to your specific requirements as shown in the example.
