# Apply data-point limits and strategies by visual type

When rendering a visual in Power BI, the visualization must be quick and accurate. That requires underlying algorithms configured for each visual type. Visuals in Power BI must be flexible enough to handle different sizes of datasets. Some datasets have only a handful of data points, while other datasets have petabytes of data points. This article explains the strategies used by Power BI to render visualizations.

## Data reduction strategies
Every visual employs one or more *data reduction strategies* in order to handle the potentially large volumes of data being analyzed. Even a simple table employs a strategy to avoid loading the entire dataset to the client.  The reduction strategy being used varies by visual type. Each visual selects from the supported *data reduction strategies* as part of generating the data request sent to the server. 

Each visual controls the parameters on those strategies to influence the overall amount of data.   

## Strategies
For each strategy, there are defaults based on the shape and type of data being visualized. But the defaults can be overridden, in the Power BI Formatting pane, to provide the right user experience. 

* **Data Windowing** (Segmentation): Allow users to scroll through the data in a visual by progressively loading fragments of the overall dataset.
* **TopN**: Show only the first N items
* **Simple Sample**: Show the first, last, and N evenly distributed items in between.
* **BottomN**: Show only the last N items.  Useful for monitoring frequently updated data.
* **High-density sampling** - An improved sampling algorithm that better respects outliers and/or the shape of a curve.
    * **Binned line sampling** - Sample data points based on outliers in bins across an axis
	* **Overlapping points sampling** - Sample data points based on overlapping values to preserve outliers

## Statistics
Certain models can provide statistics about the number of values for certain columns. When such information is present, we leverage that information to provide better balancing across multiple hierarchies, if a visual does not explicitly override the count of values for a strategy.

For more information, see [What's new in Analysis Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/analysis-services/what-s-new-in-analysis-services?view=sql-server-2017)

## Dynamic limits
In addition to the strategies above, visuals with two hierarchies of grouping columns (axis and legend, or category and series) use one additional strategy called *dynamic limits*.  Dynamic limits are designed to better balance data points. 

Dynamic limits provide a better selection of points for sparse data than static limits would. For example, a visual could be configured to select 100 categories and 10 series with a total of 1000 points. But the actual data has 50 categories and 20 series.  At query runtime, dynamic limits selects all 20 series to fill up the 1000 points requested.

Dynamic limits are automatically applied when the server is capable as detailed below:

* In Power BI Desktop with On-premises SSAS version 2016 or higher [leveraging the SuperDax capabilities of the server](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/analysisservices/2015/09/02/whats-new-in-microsoft-sql-server-analysis-services-tabular-models-in-sql-server-2016-ctp-2-3/)

* In Desktop and Power BI service when using an imported model, Direct Query, live connect to the service, or live connect to AS PaaS.Â 

* In Power BI Service, when connecting through an on-premises gateway to on-premises SSAS, we cannot use dynamic limits. The on-premises gateway does not fully support the dynamic limits strategy that returns a different structure of result sets from the on-premises SSAS.  

## Strategies and data point limits by visual type

### Area chart
See [How line sampling works](../desktop-high-density-sampling.md#how-the-new-line-sampling-algorithm-works)

### Bar/column chart
- When in categorical mode
    - Categories: Virtualization by using Window of 500 rows at a time
    - Series: Top 60
	- When in scalar mode (could use dynamic limits)
        - Max points: 10,000
		- Categories: Sample of 500 values
		- Series: Top 20 values

### Card (multirow) 
- Values: Virtualization by using Window of 200 rows at a time

### Combo chart
 Uses the same strategies as column chart. Notice that the line in the **combo chart** does not use the high-density algorithm that the **line chart** uses.

### Custom visuals
Can get up to 30,000 but it is up to the visual authors to indicate what strategies to use. The default limit is 1,000 but the visual creator can change that, up to a maximum of 30,000.

### Doughnut
- Max points: 3,500
- Group: Top 500
- Details: Top 20

### Filled map choropleth 
The filled map can use statistics or dynamic limits. Power BI tries to use reduction in the following order: dynamic limits, statistics, and lastly configuration. 
- Max points: 10000
- Categories: Top 500
- Series (when both X and Y are present): Top 20

### Funnel
- Max points: 3,500
- Categories: Top 3,500

### KPI
- Trend axis
- Bottom 3,500

### Line chart
See [How line sampling works](../desktop-high-density-sampling.md#how-the-new-line-sampling-algorithm-works)

### Line chart, high density
See [High density sampling](../desktop-high-density-sampling.md)

### Map 
- Max points: 3,500

Depending on the configuration, a map can have:
- Location: Top 3,500
- Location, Size: Top 3,500
- Location, Latitude, and Longitude aggregates (+/-Size): Top 3,500
- Latitude, Longitude: see [High density scatter](desktop-high-density-scatter-charts.md)
- Latitude, Longitude, Size: Top 3,500
- Legend, Latitude, Longitude: see [High density scatter](desktop-high-density-scatter-charts.md)
- Legend, Latitude, Longitude, Size: Top 233 legends, Top 15 latitude and longitude  (could use statistics or dynamic limits)
- Location, Legend, Latitude, and Longitude as aggregates (+/-Size): Top 233 locations, Top 15 legends  (could use statistics or dynamic limits)

### Matrix
- Rows: Virtualization by using Window of 500 rows at a time
- Columns: Top 100 grouping columns 
- Values: multiple values do not count against the data reduction

### PowerApps visual
Can get up to 30,000 but it is up to the visual authors to indicate what strategies to use. The default limit is 1,000 but the visual creator can change that, up to a maximum of 30,000.

### Radial gauge

### Slicer
