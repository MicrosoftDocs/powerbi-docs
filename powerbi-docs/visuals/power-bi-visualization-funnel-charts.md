# Funnel charts
A funnel chart helps you visualize a linear process that has sequential connected stages. For example, a sales funnel that tracks customers through stages: Lead \> Qualified Lead \> Prospect \> Contract \> Close.  At a glance, the shape of the funnel conveys the health of the process you're tracking.

Each funnel stage represents a percentage of the total. So, in most cases, a funnel chart is shaped like a funnel -- with the first stage being the largest, and each subsequent stage smaller than its predecessor.  A pear-shaped funnel is also useful -- it can identify a problem in the process.  But typically, the first stage, the "intake" stage, is the largest.

## When to use a funnel chart
Funnel charts are a great choice:

* when the data is sequential and moves through at least 4 stages.
* when the number of "items" in the first stage is expected to be greater than the number in the final stage.
* to calculate potential (revenue/sales/deals/etc.) by stages.
* to calculate and track conversion and retention rates.
* to reveal bottlenecks in a linear process.
* to track a shopping cart workflow.
* to track the progress and success of click-through advertising/marketing campaigns.

## Working with funnel charts
Funnel charts:

* Can be pinned from reports and from Q&A.
* Can be sorted.
* Support multiples.
* Can be highlighted and cross-filtered by other visualizations on the same report page.
* Can be used to highlight and cross-filter other visualizations on the same report page.

## Create a basic funnel chart

Now create your own funnel chart that shows the number of opportunities we have in each of our sales stages.

These instructions use the Opportunity Analysis Sample. To follow along, [download the sample](../sample-datasets.md) for Power BI service (app.powerbi.com) or Power BI Desktop.   

1. Start on a [blank report page ](../power-bi-report-add-page.md) and select the **SalesStage** \> **Sales Stage** field. If you're using Power BI service, make sure you open the report in [Editing View](../service-interact-with-a-report-in-editing-view.md).
   
    ![](media/power-bi-visualization-funnel-charts/funnelselectfield_new.png)
2. [Convert the chart](power-bi-report-change-visualization-type.md) to a funnel. Notice that **Sales Stage** is in the **Group** well. 
3. From the **Fields** pane, select **Fact** \> **Opportunity Count**.

4. Hovering over a bar displays a wealth of information.
   
   * The name of the stage
   * Number of opportunities currently in this stage
   * Overall conversion rate (% of Lead) 
   * Stage-to-stage (aka Drop Rate) which is the % of the previous stage (in this case, Proposal Stage/Solution Stage)

5. [Add the Funnel as a dashboard tile](../consumer/end-user-tiles.md). 
6. [Save the report](../service-report-save.md).

## Highlighting and cross-filtering
For information about using the Filters pane, see [Add a filter to a report](../power-bi-report-add-filter.md).

Highlighting a bar in a funnel cross-filters the other visualizations on the report page... and vice versa. To follow along, add a few more visuals to the report page that contains the funnel chart.

1. On the funnel, select the **Proposal** bar. This cross-highlights the other visualizations on the page. Use CTRL to multi-select.

2. To set preferences for how visuals cross-highlight and cross-filter each other, see [Visual interactions in Power BI](../consumer/end-user-interactions.md)

## Create a funnel chart in Q&A
Open the Opportunity Analysis Sample dashboard, or any other dashboard that has at least one visualization pinned from the Opportunity Analysis Sample dataset.  When you type a question in Q&A, Power BI searches for answers in all the datasets that are associated with (have tiles pinned to) the selected dashboard. For more information see, [Power BI - basic concepts](../consumer/end-user-basic-concepts.md).

1. On the Opportunity Analysis Sample dashboard, begin typing your question in the Q&A question box.

2. Be sure to add "as funnel" so Power BI knows which visualization type you'd prefer.
