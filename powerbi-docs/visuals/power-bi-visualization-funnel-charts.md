# Funnel charts

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-visuals-desktop-banner](../includes/power-bi-visuals-desktop-banner.md)]

A funnel chart helps you visualize a linear process that has sequential connected stages. For example, a sales funnel that tracks customers through stages: Lead \> Qualified Lead \> Prospect \> Contract \> Close.  At a glance, the shape of the funnel conveys the health of the process you're tracking.

Each funnel stage represents a percentage of the total. So, in most cases, a funnel chart is shaped like a funnel -- with the first stage being the largest, and each subsequent stage smaller than its predecessor.  A pear-shaped funnel is also useful -- it can identify a problem in the process.  But typically, the first stage, the "intake" stage, is the largest.

## When to use a funnel chart
Funnel charts are a great choice:

* when the data is sequential and moves through at least 4 stages.
* when the number of "items" in the first stage is expected to be greater than the number in the final stage.
* to calculate potential (revenue/sales/deals/etc.) by stages.
* to calculate and track conversion and retention rates.
* to reveal bottlenecks in a linear process.
* to track a shopping cart workflow.
* to track the progress and success of click-through advertising/marketing campaigns.

## Working with funnel charts
Funnel charts:

* Can be sorted.
* Support multiples.
* Can be highlighted and cross-filtered by other visualizations on the same report page.
* Can be used to highlight and cross-filter other visualizations on the same report page.

   > Watch this video to see Will create a funnel chart using the Sales and Marketing sample. Then follow the steps below the video to try it out yourself using the Opportunity Analysis PBIX sample file

## Prerequisite

This tutorial uses the [Opportunity Analysis sample PBIX file](https://download.microsoft.com/download/9/1/5/915ABCFA-7125-4D85-A7BD-05645BD95BD8/Opportunity%20Analysis%20Sample%20PBIX.pbix
).

1. From the upper left section of the menubar, select **File** > **Open**
   
2. Find your copy of the **Opportunity Analysis sample PBIX file**

1. Open the **Opportunity Analysis sample PBIX file** in report view ![Screenshot of the report view icon.](media/power-bi-visualization-kpi/power-bi-report-view.png).

1. Select ![Screenshot of the yellow tab.](media/power-bi-visualization-kpi/power-bi-yellow-tab.png) to add a new page.


## Create a basic funnel chart
Watch this video to see Will create a funnel chart using the Sales and Marketing sample.

Now create your own funnel chart that shows the number of opportunities we have in each of our sales stages.

1. Start on a blank report page and select the **SalesStage** \> **Sales Stage** field.
   
    ![select Sales Stage](media/power-bi-visualization-funnel-charts/funnelselectfield-new.png)

1. Select the funnel icon ![funnel chart icon](media/power-bi-visualization-funnel-charts/power-bi-funnel-icon.png) to convert the column chart to a funnel chart.

2. From the **Fields** pane, select **Fact** \> **Opportunity Count**.
   
    ![build the funnel chart](media/power-bi-visualization-funnel-charts/power-bi-funnel-2.png)
4. Hovering over a bar displays a wealth of information.
   
   * The name of the stage
   * Number of opportunities currently in this stage
   * Overall conversion rate (% of Lead) 
   * Stage-to-stage (also known as Drop Rate) which is the % of the previous stage (in this case, Proposal Stage/Solution Stage)

6. [Save the report](../service-report-save.md).

## Highlighting and cross-filtering
For information about using the Filters pane, see [Add a filter to a report](../power-bi-report-add-filter.md).

Highlighting a bar in a funnel cross-filters the other visualizations on the report page... and vice versa. To follow along, add a few more visuals to the report page that contains the funnel chart.

1. On the funnel, select the **Proposal** bar. This cross-highlights the other visualizations on the page. Use CTRL to multi-select.
