## Apply a theme

In Power BI Desktop, you can apply design changes to your entire report. With themes, you can use corporate colors, change icon sets, or apply new default visual formatting. When you apply a report theme, all visuals in your report use the colors and formatting from your selected theme. To learn more, see [Use report themes in Power BI Desktop](../create-reports/desktop-report-themes.md).

:::image type="content" source="media/service-tips-and-tricks-for-color-formatting/power-bi-themes.png" alt-text="Screenshot of theme options in the View menu.":::

Here, we applied the **Innovate** theme to the report.

:::image type="content" source="media/service-tips-and-tricks-for-color-formatting/power-bi-theme-innovate.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Innovate theme applied to a report.":::

Report themes aren't available in the Power BI service.

## Change the color of a single data point

Sometimes you want to highlight one particular data point. Perhaps it's a sales figure for the launch of a new product, or improvements in quality scores after launching a new program. With Power BI, you can highlight a particular data point by changing its color.

The following visualization ranks units sold by product segment. 

:::image type="content" source="media/service-tips-and-tricks-for-color-formatting/power-bi-format.png" alt-text="Screenshot of data colors changed to one color.":::

Imagine you want to call out the **Extreme** segment to show how well this brand new segment is performing by using color. Here are the steps:

For each visual type, there are many color options. You can color text, gridlines, backgrounds, and more. The path to the **Color** option that you want might not be the same across visuals. For that reason, select the visual and then use the Search bar to find the chart feature that you want to color. For a column chart, search for **Column**. The color option we want is on the **Columns** card. 

:::image type="content" source="media/service-tips-and-tricks-for-color-formatting/power-bi-search-color.png" alt-text="Screenshot of searching for the option to color bars in a chart.":::

From the **Categories** dropdown, select **All** to set the same color for all columns. To change the color of the Extreme column, select **Extreme** from the **Categories** dropdown and the new color from the **Color** card. 

:::image type="content" source="media/service-tips-and-tricks-for-color-formatting/power-bi-color-orange.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Colors card with Extreme color changed to orange.":::

Once selected, the **Extreme** data point is a nice shade of orange, and certainly stands out.

If you expect to add new columns to the chart and want to maintain the same color scheme, be sure to set the **Default color** to blue.

Even if you change visualization types and then return, Power BI remembers your selection and keeps **Extreme** orange.

## Change the color of all data points

You can change the color of a data point for one, several, or all data elements in the visualization. Perhaps you want your visual to mimic your corporate colors of yellow, green, and blue. 

:::image type="content" source="media/service-tips-and-tricks-for-color-formatting/power-bi-corporate.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Bar chart with bars that are green, yellow, and blue.":::

Perhaps you want a different color for each category. 

:::image type="content" source="media/service-tips-and-tricks-for-color-formatting/power-bi-line-charts.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Line chart with five categories.":::

Notice that the legend colors match the data colors. Legend colors aren't set separately, but inherit the colors set for the **Data colors**. 

> [!NOTE]
> There are certain circumstances where Power BI changes the legend (and data) colors. One example is when your visual is created using streaming data, a new month begins, and a new category is introduced into your visual. Let's say that you've set the data colors for all five categories in the line chart, and now it's Jan-13 and another manufacturer has entered the market. Because you did not set a data color for that new manufacturer, you might find that Power BI has changed the data colors for the original five manufacturers. When a new category is introduced, you might have to reassign data colors to the new and existing categories using the **Formatting > Data colors** pane.  

There are all sorts of things you can do with colors. In the next section, we take a look at conditional formatting.

## Add conditional formatting for visuals

Visualizations often benefit from dynamically setting color based on the numeric value of a field. You can show a different value for the size of a bar, show two values on a single graph, or highlight data points over (or under) a certain value, perhaps highlighting areas of low profitability.

The following sections demonstrate different ways to base color on a numeric value.

### Base the color of data points on a value

To change color based on a value, select a visualization to make it active. Open the **Format your visual** pane by selecting the **paint brush** icon and then search for the **Colors** card. Since our example uses a column chart, scroll down to **Columns**. Next to **Default**, select the **fx** icon.  

:::image type="content" source="media/service-tips-and-tricks-for-color-formatting/power-bi-conditional.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Colors card under Columns.":::

In the **Default color** dialog box, use the dropdowns to identify the fields to use for conditional formatting. In this example, we apply a gradient and select the **Count of Product** field. Then we select light blue for the **Lowest value** and dark blue for **Highest value**. 

:::image type="content" source="media/service-tips-and-tricks-for-color-formatting/power-bi-conditional-formatting-new.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Default color pane.":::

:::image type="content" source="media/service-tips-and-tricks-for-color-formatting/power-bi-default-colors.png" alt-text="Screenshot of column chart with default colors applied.":::

You can also format the color of the visual using a field that isn't part of the visual. In the following image, we use **% Units Market Share SPLY**. 

:::image type="content" source="media/service-tips-and-tricks-for-color-formatting/power-bi-conditional-colors.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Column chart with multiple shades of blue.":::

As you can see, we sold more units of **Productivity**, **Convenience**, and **Extreme** (their columns are higher). However, **Moderation** has a larger **% Units Market Share SPLY** (its column has more color saturation).

### Customize the colors used in the color scale

You can also change the way the values map to these colors. In the following image, the colors for **Minimum** and **Maximum** are set to red and green, respectively.

In this first image, notice how the bars in the chart reflect the gradient shown in the bar. The highest value is green, the lowest is red, and each bar in between is colored with a shade of the spectrum between green and red.

:::image type="content" source="media/service-tips-and-tricks-for-color-formatting/power-bi-conditional-4.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Column chart showing gradient of colors ranging from green to red.":::

Now, let's see what happens if we provide numeric values in the **Minimum** and **Maximum** value boxes. Select **Custom** from the drop-down boxes for both **Minimum** and **Maximum**, and set **Minimum** to 250, and set **Maximum** to 600.

:::image type="content" source="media/service-tips-and-tricks-for-color-formatting/power-bi-conditional-formatting-numbers.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Default color options with maximum and minimum values.":::

By setting those values, gradient is no longer applied to values on the chart that are below **Minimum** or above **Maximum**; any bar with a value over **Maximum** value is colored green, and any bar with a value under **Minimum** value is colored red.

:::image type="content" source="media/service-tips-and-tricks-for-color-formatting/power-bi-conditional-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot of chart using maximum and minimum values for colors.":::

### Use diverging color scales

Sometimes your data might have a naturally diverging scale. For example, a temperate range has a natural center at freezing point, and a profitability score has a natural midpoint (zero).

To use diverging color scales, check the box for  **Add a middle color**. Another color selector called **Center** appears.

:::image type="content" source="media/service-tips-and-tricks-for-color-formatting/power-bi-diverging-colors.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Default color dialog with Color scale selected.":::

When **Add a middle color** is selected, you can set the colors for **Minimum**, **Maximum**, and **Center** separately. In the following image, bars with values near the center of the range are now colored yellow.

:::image type="content" source="media/service-tips-and-tricks-for-color-formatting/power-bi-diverging.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Column chart with divergent colors.":::

## Add color to table rows

Tables and matrixes offer many options for color formatting. 

:::image type="content" source="media/service-tips-and-tricks-for-color-formatting/power-bi-table.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows a table with alternating white and gray rows.":::

One of the quickest ways to apply color to a table or matrix is to open the Format pane and select **Style presets**. Here, we select **Bold header flashy rows**.

:::image type="content" source="media/service-tips-and-tricks-for-color-formatting/power-bi-table-style.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the style option of Bold header flashy rows, which makes the header row black and the other rows light and dark green.":::

Experiment with other color formatting options. In this image, we change the background color under **Column headers** and change both the **Background color** and **Alternate background color** for the **Values** (rows).

:::image type="content" source="media/service-tips-and-tricks-for-color-formatting/power-bi-value-colors.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows value selectors for Background color and Alternate background color.":::

## Undo in Power BI

Like many other Microsoft services and software, Power BI provides an easy way to undo your last command. For example, let's say you change the color of a data point, or a series of data points, and you don't like the color when it appears in the visualization. You don't recall exactly which color it was before, but you know you want that color back.

To undo your last action, or the last few actions, all you have to do is type **CTRL** + **Z**.

To discard all the changes you make on a Formatting card, select **Reset to default**.
