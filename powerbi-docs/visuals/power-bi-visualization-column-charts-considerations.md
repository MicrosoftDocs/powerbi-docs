# Column chart considerations and limitations

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-yes-desktop-yes-service.md)]


As a Power BI user, the awareness of any column chart considerations and limitations is helpful when creating effective and visually appealing data visualizations.

Understanding the considerations and limitations allow you to make informed decisions and leverage the full potential of Power BI column charts. Whether you're a novice or an experienced user, this article aims to enhance your chart-building experience by keeping you up-to-date with practical insights and tips for any known issues.

## Considerations and limitations

This article provides an updated list of known column chart considerations and limitations, designed to help you navigate the nuances of column charts in both Power BI Desktop and the Power BI service.

### X-axis

#### Default scrolling position

In Power BI, when the categorical axis is set as the X-axis, users may encounter inconvenience with the scrollbar starting on the left, particularly when displaying date/time values. This issue arises because there is no setting available to control the default scrolling position, which can be problematic when users wish to view dates from earliest to latest. It is recommended to use a continuous axis instead of a categorical axis when working with date/time values. This will allow for a more intuitive display of data over time, with the scrollbar beginning at the earliest date as expected.

#### Intervals

Users have expressed a need to control intervals for numerical or date/time values on a continuous axis in Power BI. Unfortunately, there are currently no settings available to manage these intervals directly. The intervals on a continuous axis are automatically determined by Power BI based on the data points visible and the size of the visual container. This automatic adjustment is designed to optimize the display of data within the available space. As of now, there is no workaround to manually set these intervals. Users must rely on the automatic interval settings determined by Power BI.

#### Conditional formatting on X-axis values

In Power BI, axis colors determined by conditional formatting are currently based on a general value rather than individual categories. This behavior occurs because conditional formatting for axis colors is applied uniformly across all categories. As a result, individual category distinctions are not reflected in the axis coloration, leading to a less customized visual representation. While Power BI does not offer a direct feature to assign conditional formatting to axis colors on a per-category basis, a workaround involves creating a separate data series for each category. This series can then be formatted individually, allowing for distinct axis colors corresponding to each category’s value.

### Y-axis

#### Intervals

Power BI users have reported difficulties in controlling the intervals on the secondary axis. This limitation arises because Power BI currently lacks direct settings to adjust these intervals. The intervals for the secondary axis are automatically calculated by Power BI, which considers the highest and lowest data values along with the visual container’s dimensions. This automatic scaling is intended to ensure the most effective use of space and the best possible data representation. At present, there is no manual method to override these automatic interval settings. Users must adapt to the intervals that Power BI determines to be most suitable for their data visualization needs.

### Small multiples

#### Hierarchical axis

In Power BI, when utilizing small multiples, the hierarchical axis is not supported. This limitation results in the axis defaulting to a concatenated format. This behavior occurs because small multiples are designed to display separate, distinct data points across multiple charts, and the hierarchical structure is not maintained when the axis is split into these individual elements.

#### Data value settings

When creating small multiples in Power BI, the titles are currently missing data value settings such as display units, decimal places, and custom format options. These settings are essential for precise data representation and cannot be modified directly within the small multiples feature. This limitation arises because small multiples are designed to compare and contrast trends across multiple charts, and the title formatting options are not as extensive as those for individual visuals. The absence of these settings can lead to less informative and harder-to-read titles, affecting the overall effectiveness of data visualization. To address this, consider modifying these settings at the Model level, where you have more control over the data representation. Alternatively, you can use visual-level formatting to apply custom format strings to individual elements within your report, overriding the default settings where necessary.

### Columns

#### Series color assignment

In Power BI, the assignment of [theme colors to series](../create-reports/desktop-report-themes.md#dynamic-series) can vary depending on whether the series is static or dynamic. This can lead to inconsistencies in color representation across different report views. Please review the [Series color assignment](power-bi-visualization-troubleshoot.md#series-color-assignment) section of the [Troubleshoot visualizations in Power BI](power-bi-visualization-troubleshoot.md) article for detailed and up-to-date information.

### Report locale

#### Format strings

In Power BI, certain visual elements do not utilize the model format string for dates to conserve space and present only the necessary detail. Please review the [Format strings](power-bi-visualization-troubleshoot.md#format-strings) section of the [Troubleshoot visualizations in Power BI](power-bi-visualization-troubleshoot.md) article for detailed and up-to-date information.

#### Display units suffix

Users have encountered a challenge where the display units suffix in Power BI visuals automatically adjust based on location or system settings. Please review the [Display units suffix](power-bi-visualization-troubleshoot.md#display-units-suffix) section of the [Troubleshoot visualizations in Power BI](power-bi-visualization-troubleshoot.md) article for detailed and up-to-date information.
