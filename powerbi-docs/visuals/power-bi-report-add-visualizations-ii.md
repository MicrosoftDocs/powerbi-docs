# Add visuals to a Power BI report (part 2)

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-yes-desktop-yes-service.md)]

In [part 1](power-bi-report-add-visualizations-i.md) of this series of two articles, you created a basic visualization by selecting checkboxes next to field names. In this article, you learn how to use drag-and-drop and the **Data** and **Visualizations** panes to create and modify visualizations.

## Create a new visualization

In this tutorial, you use the Retail Analysis Sample semantic model to create a few visualizations.

## Prerequisites

# [Power BI Desktop](#tab/powerbi-desktop)

1. Download the [Retail Analysis Sample PBIX file](https://download.microsoft.com/download/9/6/D/96DDC2FF-2568-491D-AAFA-AFDD6F763AE3/Retail%20Analysis%20Sample%20PBIX.pbix).

1. In Power BI Desktop, select **File** > **Open report**.

1. Browse to and select the **Retail Analysis Sample PBIX** file, and then select **Open**.

1. The **Retail Analysis Sample PBIX** file opens in report view. :::image type="icon" source="media/power-bi-report-add-visualizations-ii/power-bi-report-view.png":::

1. At the bottom, select the green plus symbol :::image type="icon" source="media/power-bi-report-add-visualizations-ii/power-bi-plus-green-tab.png"::: to add a new page to the report.

# [Power BI service](#tab/powerbi-service)

This tutorial uses the Retail Analysis Sample in the Power BI service.

1. Sign in to the Power BI service (`app.powerbi.com`).

1. Select **Learn** in the navigation pane.

1. On the **Learning center** page, under **Sample reports**, locate and select the **Retail Analysis Sample** to download it.

1. The **Retail Analysis Sample** opens in report view:

   :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-report-add-visualizations-ii/power-bi-retail-analysis-sample.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Retail Analysis Sample open in report view in the Power BI service." lightbox="media/power-bi-report-add-visualizations-ii/power-bi-retail-analysis-sample-expanded.png" border="false":::

1. At the top, select **Edit** to display the **Visualizations** pane.

1. At the bottom, select the green plus symbol :::image type="icon" source="media/power-bi-report-add-visualizations-i/power-bi-plus-green-tab.png"::: to add a new page to the report.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to share your report with a colleague, you both need to have individual Power BI Pro licenses or the report needs to be saved in Premium capacity. For more information, see [Share a filtered Power BI report](../collaborate-share/service-share-reports.md).

## Add visualizations to the report

You can create a visualization by selecting a field in the **Data** pane. Power BI uses the type of field that you select to determine which visualization type to use. You can change the visualization type by selecting a different icon in the **Visualizations** pane. Keep in mind that not all visualizations can display all data types. For example, geographic data doesn't display well in a funnel chart or line chart.

### Add an area chart that compares this year's sales to last year's sales

1. In the **Data** pane, expand **Sales** and select the **Last Year Sales** checkbox. Then expand **This Year Sales** and select the **Value** checkbox. Power BI creates a column chart. This chart is interesting, and you want to look closer. What do the sales look like by month?  

   :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-report-add-visualizations-ii/compare-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a column chart.":::

1. In the **Data** pane, expand **Time** and drag **FiscalMonth** to the **X-axis** area of the **Visualizations** pane. You can now see comparisons by month: 

   :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-report-add-visualizations-ii/compare-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a column chart with FiscalMonth as the axis.":::

1. In this step, you change the visualization type. There are many visualization types to choose from. To decide which type to use, see [descriptions of each, tips for best practices, and tutorials](power-bi-visualization-types-for-reports-and-q-and-a.md). To use an area chart, in the **Visualizations** pane, select the **Area chart** button:

   :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-report-add-visualizations-ii/compare-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Area chart button.":::

1. Sort the visualization by selecting **More options** (...) at the top of the chart and then selecting **Sort axis** > **FiscalMonth**:

   :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-report-add-visualizations-ii/compare-4.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the More options menu.":::

1. [Resize the visualization](power-bi-visualization-move-and-resize.md) by selecting it and dragging one of the frame handles. Make it wide enough to eliminate the scrollbar but small enough to leave room for another visualization:

   :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-report-add-visualizations-ii/pbi_part2_7b.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the area chart visualization.":::

1. Save the report.

### Add a map visualization that illustrates sales by location

1. In the **Data** pane, expand **Store** and select **Territory**. Power BI recognizes that **Territory** is a location and creates a map visualization. Drag **Total Stores** to the **Bubble size** area on the **Visualizations** pane:

   :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-report-add-visualizations-ii/map-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a map chart.":::

1. To add a legend, drag **Store** > **Chain** to the **Legend** area. You now see the data sorted by store name, and there's a legend above the map:

   :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-report-add-visualizations-ii/map-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Chain in the fields list and in the Legend area.":::
