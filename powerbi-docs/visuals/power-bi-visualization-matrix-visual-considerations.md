# Matrix visual considerations and limitations

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-yes-desktop-yes-service.md)]

As a Power BI user, the awareness of any considerations and limitations for matrix visuals is helpful when creating effective and visually appealing data visualizations.

Understanding the considerations and limitations allow you to make informed decisions and apply the full potential of Power BI matrix visuals. Whether you're a novice or an experienced user, this article aims to enhance your matrix visual experience by keeping you up-to-date with practical insights and tips for any known issues.

## Considerations and limitations

This article provides an updated list of known considerations and limitations for matrix visuals, designed to help you navigate the nuances of matrix visuals in both Power BI Desktop and the Power BI service.

### Column headers

#### Column size

Users expressed the need for consistent column header sizes in Power BI matrix visuals, as there's currently no feature to set a fixed pixel width for all columns. Power BI matrix visuals don't offer an option to apply a uniform width across all column headers using a fixed number of pixels. The common workaround is to manually adjust each column header and disable the autosize width feature to maintain the desired size. While this workaround method isn't ideal, it allows users to achieve a consistent look across all column headers.

#### Dynamic column header text

Users often inquire about using conditional formatting for column header text. Currently, Power BI doesn't support the functionality to dynamically adjust column header text based on measures. As of now, users can swap columns with field parameters.

#### Customization

In Power BI, users are unable to format hierarchical levels of column headers individually. The formatting options are limited to the lowest hierarchy level. This limitation arises because Power BI currently only allows customization of the lowest hierarchy level under the specific columnâ€™s '**Apply to header**' setting. The upper hierarchy levels inherit the settings defined under the general '**Column headers**' formatting options. As a workaround, users can format the lower hierarchy level to their preference and the upper levels will automatically apply the same settings. While this doesn't allow for individual formatting of each hierarchical level, it ensures a consistent look across the column headers.

### Totals

#### Total calculation

Users might encounter situations where the total values in a matrix appear broken or return undesirable results. This can occur due to various reasons, such as complex data models, specific DAX calculations, or the way certain fields are aggregated within the matrix. Creating a custom DAX formula is the recommended workaround to resolve this issue. The DAX formula can be tailored to accurately calculate the total values based on the unique requirements of the data and the desired outcome.
