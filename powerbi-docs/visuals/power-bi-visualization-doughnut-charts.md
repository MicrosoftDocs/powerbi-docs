# Create and use doughnut charts in Power BI

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-yes-desktop-yes-service.md)]

A doughnut chart is similar to a pie chart in that it shows the relationship of parts to a whole. The only difference is that the center is blank and allows space for a label or icon.

Doughnut charts work best when you use them to compare a particular section to the whole, rather than comparing individual sections with each other.

## Prerequisites

Sharing your report with a Power BI colleague requires that you both have licenses for the paid version of Power BI or that the report is saved in Premium capacity.

## Get the sample

To follow along, download the Retail Analysis sample .pbix file in Power BI Desktop or the Power BI service.

## Create a doughnut chart

Follow these steps to create a doughnut chart.

1. Start on a blank report page and from the **Data** pane, select **Sales**, then select the **Last Year Sales** checkbox.  

1. On the **Visualizations** pane, select the icon for doughnut chart :::image type="icon" source="media/power-bi-visualization-doughnut-charts/power-bi-icon.png" ::: to convert your bar chart to a doughnut chart. If **Last Year Sales** isn't in the **Values** section of the **Visualizations** pane, drag it there.

   :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-visualization-doughnut-charts/power-bi-doughnut-chart.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Visualization pane with a doughnut chart selected.":::

1. Select **Item** \> **Category** to add it to the **Legend** area of the **Visualizations** pane.

   :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-visualization-doughnut-charts/power-bi-doughnut-done.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a doughnut chart next to the Data pane.":::

1. To see details within each section of a doughnut chart, add a category to the **Details** field. 

     :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-visualization-doughnut-charts/power-bi-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a doughnut chart with Details next to the Data pane.":::

1. Optionally, [adjust the size and color of the chart's text](power-bi-visualization-customize-title-background-and-legend.md).

## Considerations and troubleshooting

Here are a few things to consider as you work with doughnut charts.

- The sum of the doughnut chart values must add up to 100%.
- Too many categories create small slices in the chart. Small slices can be difficult to read and interpret.
