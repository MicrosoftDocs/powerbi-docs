# Create and use a text slicer (preview)

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-desktop-no-service](../includes/applies-yes-desktop-no-service.md)]

The Text slicer visual in Power BI Desktop is an interactive element that enables you to filter data directly within reports and dashboards using free-form text input. Unlike traditional slicers with predefined categories, text slicers let you define custom filter criteria, making them ideal for exact string matching and flexible data exploration.

This article shows you how to create and customize text slicers to enhance your Power BI reports with dynamic, text-based filtering capabilities.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Text slicer (preview) is currently in preview and only available for Power BI Desktop. This information relates to a prerelease product that might be substantially modified before it's released. Microsoft makes no warranties, expressed or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

## Create a text slicer

In this quick and easy three-step guide, you create a **text slicer** in Power **BI Desktop**. Review the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section before following these steps.

1. With the **Retail Analysis Sample PBIX** open, make sure you're on the Overview page by selecting the **Overview** tab. To make room for your text slicer, select and resize the scatter chart by dragging the dark **visualization handles**. Then, with nothing selected on the report canvas, select the **text slicer** icon in the **Build visual** tab on the **Visualizations** pane to create a new slicer on the report canvas.

1. To add data to the visual, use the **Data** pane. With your slicer selected on the report canvas, go to the Data pane, expand the **District** table, and select **DM** to populate the slicer. The slicer now displays an input text box for filtering district manager names. You can resize the slicer as needed and rearrange the elements on the canvas to your preference. Be careful not to make the slicer too small, which affects the displayed information.

1. To customize your slicer, select the **Format visual** icon in the **Visualizations** pane. This icon grants you access to all available format settings. You can tailor the slicer's appearance and functionality to your specific requirements.

## Considerations and limitations

This section provides a list of known considerations and limitations. It helps you navigate the nuances of the Text slicer (preview) in Power BI Desktop.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because the Text slicer is a preview feature in Power BI Desktop, the following considerations and limitations apply.

- **Power BI service**:
  - Users can't see the Text slicer (preview) in the **Power BI service** because it's currently a preview feature exclusive to **Power BI Desktop**.
  - The Text slicer (preview) is in the preview phase and is only available within the Power BI Desktop environment. This limitation is a common practice for features that are still under development, allowing users to test and provide feedback before a broader release.
  - Although the Text slicer (preview) isn't directly available in the Power BI service, you can publish any Text slicer (preview) you create in Power BI Desktop, making it visible in the Power BI service. This capability allows users to take advantage of the new features while ensuring compatibility and stability within the Service environment.
- **Format settings**:
  - When you're formatting a text slicer (preview), you might notice that some of the format settings are in a different location, or the name of the setting is changed.
  - Often, new settings or controls are added from one product update to the next. Such changes are expected, as preview features are continuously under development.
  - They're subject to modifications that enhance functionality and user experience. It's the responsibility of report creators to stay informed about these changes when using preview features.
  - Keeping abreast of product updates ensure the effective use of these features in your reports.
- **Accessibility**:
  - During the preview phase, certain accessibility features such as keyboard navigation and screen-reader support might not be fully operational.
  - However, we're committed to ensuring that all functionalities comply with accessibility standards upon the conclusion of the preview period.
- **Filter logic and operators**:
  - The Text slicer uses contains as its default filter logic and applies an or operator when multiple values are entered. This logic means that any record containing one or more of the input strings is returned.
- **Text slicer as input control**:
  - You can configure the text slicer as a pure input control by meeting the 'Field' assignment in the build pane. This configuration disables its filtering capability and transforms it into a parameter input mechanism.
  - This setup is essential for Translytical Task Flows, especially when passing parameters that aren't tied to a specific data field, such as comments, annotations, or external triggers.
  - When used this way, the slicer activates the User Data Function through a button, provided the parameter is marked as required. This configuration enables workflows like writebacks, approvals, or notifications, without relying on dataset-bound filtering.
