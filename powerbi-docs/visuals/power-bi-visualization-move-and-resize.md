# Move and resize a visualization in a report in Power BI service and Power BI Desktop
Only report creators and owners can move and resize visualizations. In Power BI service (app.powerbi.com) this means opening the report in [Editing view](../consumer/end-user-reading-view.md).

## Open the report
In Power BI, open a report that has at least one visualization, or [create a new visualization](power-bi-report-add-visualizations-i.md). 

## Move the visualizationï»¿
* Select (left-click) any area of the visualization and drag to the new location.

## Resize the visualization
* Select the visualization to display the border and click and drag the dark frame handles to resize.
