# Move and resize a visualization in a report

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-yes-desktop-yes-service.md)]

Report designers and owners can move and resize visualizations. If you're working in the Power BI service (app.powerbi.com), you'll need to open the report in [Editing view](../create-reports/service-interact-with-a-report-in-editing-view.md).

## Open the report
In Power BI Desktop, open a report with at least one visualization, or [create a new visualization](power-bi-report-add-visualizations-i.md).

## Move the visualization
* To move the visualization, select (left-click) any area of the visualization, then drag it to the new location.

## Resize the visualization
* If you want to resize the visualization, select the visualization to display the border, drag the dark frame handles to resize.
