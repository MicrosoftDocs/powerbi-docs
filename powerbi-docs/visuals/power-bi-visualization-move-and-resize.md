# Move and resize a visualization in a report

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-yes-desktop-yes-service.md)]

Report designers and owners can move and resize visualizations. If you're working in the Power BI service (app.powerbi.com) you'll need to open the report in [Editing view](../create-reports/service-interact-with-a-report-in-editing-view.md). 

## Open the report
In Power BI Desktop, open a report that has at least one visualization, or [create a new visualization](power-bi-report-add-visualizations-i.md). 

## Move the visualization
* Select (left-click) any area of the visualization and drag to the new location.

## Resize the visualization
* Select the visualization to display the border and click and drag the dark frame handles to resize.

## Select Focus mode to see more detail.
* Hover over the visualization and select the Focus mode icon.
