# Customize visualization titles, legends, and backgrounds
In this tutorial you'll learn a few different ways to customize your visualizations.   There are so many options for customizing your visualizations, the best way to learn about them all is by exploring the Formatting pane (select the paintroller icon).  To get you started, this article shows you how to customize a visualization title, legend, and background.  

Not all visualizations can be customized, [see the complete list](#list).  

Watch Amanda customize visualizations in her report (fast-forward to 4:50 in the video). Then follow the instructions below the video to try it out yourself with your own data.

### Prerequisites
- Power BI service or Power BI Desktop

## Customize visualization titles in reports
To follow along, sign into Power BI service (app.powerbi.com) and [open the Retail Analysis Sample](../sample-datasets.md) report in [Editing View](../service-interact-with-a-report-in-editing-view.md).

> [!NOTE]
> When you pin a visualization to a dashboard, it becomes a dashboard tile.  The tiles themselves can also be customized with [new titles and subtitles, hyperlinks, and resized](../service-dashboard-edit-tile.md).
> 
> 

1. Navigate to the "New Stores" page of the report and select the "Open Store Count by Open Month..." column chart.
2. In the Visualizations pane, select the paintroller icon to reveal the formatting options.  and select **Title** to expand that section.

4. Change **Title Text** by typing **Store count by month opened** in the text field.  
5. Change **Font color** to orange and **Background Color** to yellow.

   You can always revert to the default colors by selecting **Revert to default** in the color window.
6. Increase the text size to 12.
7. The last customization we'll make to the chart title is to align it in the center of the visualization. The title position defaults to left-aligned.

    At this point in the tutorial, your column chart **title** should look like something like this:

    To revert all the title customization we've done so far, select **Revert To Default**, at the bottom of the **Title** customization pane.
