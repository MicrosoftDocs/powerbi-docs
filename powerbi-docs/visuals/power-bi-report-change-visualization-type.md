# Change the type of visualization in a Power BI report
Try different types of visualizations in Power BI service and Power BI Desktop to see which one illustrates your data best. 

1. Open a report that already has at least one visualization.   
2. Select a visualization to make it active. An active visualization has handles and a border.    
3. In the Visualizations pane, select the new visualization type.

4. (Optional) [Pin your visualization](../service-dashboard-pin-tile-from-report.md) to your dashboard as a tile. 

If you change the visualization type in the report after you pinned it to your dashboard, the dashboard tile does not automatically update. So, if you pinned the visualization as a line chart and then, in the report, changed it to a bar chart, the already-pinned version of this data will remain a line chart. Pin the bar chart to see it too on the dashboard.
