# Enroll your US Government organization in the Power BI service
The **Power BI service** has a version available for United States Government customers as part of the **Office 365 US Government Community** subscriptions. The **Power BI service** version discussed in this article is designed for US Government customers, and is separate and different from the commercial version of the **Power BI service**.

Your US Government organization might be new to the **Office Government Cloud**, or might already have a subscription. The following sections detail the sign-up steps based on where you are with the Office Government Cloud and Power BI, and are different based on your existing subscription.

### Whitelisting Instructions
*Whitelisting* is a process that the Power BI engineering team uses to move customers from the commercial cloud environment into the secure, Government cloud environment. This ensures that features available in the US Government cloud work as expected. All existing (or new) US Government customers that purchase US Government **Power BI** services for the first time *must* initiate the following whitelisting process. The process must be done prior to setup or migration to US Government **Power BI** services. 

To have your tenant *whitelisted* for the US Government cloud, contact the Microsoft account team for assistance with whitelisting. Only administrators can make this request. The process for *whitelisting* takes approximately three weeks, during which the Power BI engineering team makes appropriate changes to ensure your tenant operates properly in the US Government cloud.

Customers migrating from Power BI **Free** licenses to **Power BI US Government** (and by definition, migrating to the associated **Pro** license features described earlier in this article) will encounter the issues described in the following section of this article, until their tenant is *whitelisted* by the Power BI engineering team.

### Mixed Free and Pro licenses in US Government tenants
If you have both Free and US Government Pro licenses in your tenant, both Free and (US Government) Pro licenses remain present, but one or the other license types will not work properly. If your tenant successfully goes through the *whitelisting* process, then the following occurs:

* Any Free license users will no longer be able to sign in to Power BI using **Power BI Desktop**, and will experience functionality gaps described in the following section.
* All clients assigned to US Government Pro licenses will work as expected, including use of gateways, Power BI Desktop, and Mobile apps.

When using a mix of Free and Pro licenses in a US Government tenant, and going through the *whitelisting* process, the following can be expected:

**Before _whitelisting_**:

* Users with Free licenses are running in commercial cloud
* Pro US Government licenses show up in the portal, and the administrator can assign those licenses to users. Pro US Government users will not lose data from their Free licenses once the admin assigns a US Government Pro license. The assigned users have access Power BI Pro features for US Government customers, but the following bullet list functionality gaps will exist until the tenant is successfully *whitelisted*:
  
  * Gateway, Mobile, and Power BI Desktop canâ€™t authenticate
  * You cannot access Azure commercial data sources
  * PBIX files must be manually uploaded from the commercial Power BI service
  * Power BI mobile apps are not available

**After _whitelisting_**:

* Free users running in the commercial Power BI service can continue to run, but the they will stop authenticating as expected.
* Pro users running in the US Government cloud can use the **Power BI for US Government customers** service as expected.

To identifying users in your tenant that are running the Free license of Power BI, administrators can run the licensing report, after which Free license users show up as **Power BI Standard**.
