# Enroll your US Government organization in the Power BI service

There's a version of the Power BI service as part of the [Office 365 Government plans](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/government/compare-office-365-government-plans?rtc=1). This article is designed for US Government customers, and the enrollment process described here is different from the commercial version of the Power BI service.

For more information about the Power BI service for US Government, check out [Power BI for United States Government customers - Overview](service-govus-overview.md).

> [!NOTE]
> This article is intended for administrators who have authority to sign up their US Government organization for Power BI. If you are an end-user, contact your administrator about getting a subscription to Power BI for US Government.

## Select the right sign-up process for your US Government organization

Your US Government organization might be new to the government cloud community, or might already have a subscription. The following sections detail the sign-up steps based on where you are with the Office 365 Government plans and Power BI. The steps are different depending on your current enrollment.

After you sign up for Power BI US Government, work with your account team to start the [*whitelisting* process](#additional-signup-information) described in this article. That step is needed to fully enable your organization in the government community cloud.

## Sign up for a new Office 365 Government plan

If your organization is new to the government cloud community, follow these steps to get an Office 365 Government plan:

> [!NOTE]
> These steps should be performed by the global administrator.

2. Select **Get started with a free trial**.

After this process is complete, follow the steps for existing Office 365 Government customers to add a Power BI subscription.

## Add Power BI to an Office 365 Government plan

If your organization already has an Office 365 Government plan, follow these steps to add a Power BI subscription:

> [!NOTE]
> These steps should be performed by the global administrator.
> 
> 

1. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center, using your global admin or billing admin credentials.
2. Select **Billing** > **Purchase services**.
4. Search or scroll to locate the Power BI Pro Government offer and choose **Try** or **Buy Now**
5. Complete your order.
6. Assign licenses to user accounts.

## Additional signup information

Before you can use US Government Power BI services, you have to work with your Microsoft account team to initiate *whitelisting* for your organization. Whitelisting is a process that the Power BI engineering team uses to move customers from the commercial cloud environment into the secure, government community cloud. This step ensures that features available in the US Government cloud work as expected. 

To start the whitelisting process, contact your Microsoft account team for assistance. Only administrators can request whitelisting. The process takes about three weeks. During this time, the Power BI engineering team makes appropriate changes to ensure your tenant operates properly in the US Government cloud.
