# Monitor Power BI Premium and Power BI Embedded capacities

This article provides an overview of monitoring the metrics for your Power BI Premium capacities. Monitoring capacity usage enables you to take an informed approach to managing your capacities.

You can monitor capacity with the Power BI Premium Capacity Metrics app or in the admin portal. We recommend the app, because it provides much more detail, but this article covers both options.

**The current version of the app is 1.9 (released November 14, 2018).**

## Install the Premium Capacity Metrics app

You can go straight to the [Premium Capacity Metrics app](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/getapps/services/capacitymetrics) or install it like you do other apps in Power BI.

1. In Power BI, click **Apps**.

    ![Go to Apps](media/service-admin-premium-monitor-capacity/apps.png)

1. On the right side, click **Get apps**.

1. In the **Apps** category, search for **Power BI Premium Capacity Metrics app**.

1. Subscribe to install the app.

Now that you've installed the app, you can see metrics about the capacities in your organization. Let's take a look at some of the key metrics that are available.

## Use the metrics app

When you open the app, it first shows a dashboard with a summary of all the capacities for which you have admin rights.

![Metrics app dashboard](media/service-admin-premium-monitor-capacity/app-dashboard.png)

Click the dashboard to go to the underlying report. The report has six tabs, which we describe in more detail in the following sections.

* **Filters**: enables you to filter the other pages in the report to a specific capacity.

* **Datasets**: detailed metrics on the health of the Power BI datasets in your capacities.

* **Paginated reports**: detailed metrics on the health of the paginated reports in your capacities.

* **Dataflows**: detailed refresh metrics for dataflows in your capacities.

* **System**: overall capacity metrics including memory and CPU high utilization.

* **Display Names and IDs**: names, IDs, and owners for capacities, workspaces, and workloads.

### Filters tab

The **Filters** tab enables you to select a capacity, a date range, and other options. Filters are then applied to all the relevant pages and tiles in the report. If no filters are selected, the report defaults to show the past week’s metrics on every capacity you own.

![Filters tab](media/service-admin-premium-monitor-capacity/filters-tab.png)

* **(A)** Select **Datasets**, **Paginated Reports**, or **Dataflows** to set filters for each workload.

* **(B)** Name and **(C)** information are updated based on what you select in **(A)**, allowing you to filter on a workload by name. For example, in the image above, **Dataflows** is selected, showing **Dataflows Name** and **Dataflows Information**.

* **(D)** Capacity information, which indicates if datasets, paginated reports, or dataflows are enabled for a capacity.

### Datasets tab

Use the buttons at the top of the **Datasets** tab to navigate to different areas: **Summary**, **Refreshes**, **Query Durations**, **Query Waits**, and **Datasets**.

## Monitor Power BI Embedded capacity

You can also use the Power BI Premium Capacity Metrics app to monitor *A SKU* capacities in Power BI Embedded. Those capacities will show up in the report as long as you are an admin of the capacity. However, refresh of the report fails unless you grant certain permissions to Power BI on your A SKUs:

1. Open your capacity in the Azure portal.

1. Click **Access control (IAM)**, and add the “Power BI Premium” app to the reader role. If you are unable to find the app by name, you can also add it by its client Id: cb4dc29f-0bf4-402a-8b30-7511498ed654.

    ![Permissions for Power BI Embedded](media/service-admin-premium-monitor-capacity/embedded-permissions.png)

> [!NOTE]
> You can monitor Power BI Embedded capacity usage in the app or the Azure portal, but not in the Power BI admin portal.

## Basic monitoring in the admin portal

The **Capacity settings** area of the admin portal provides four gauges that indicate the loads placed and the resources utilized by your capacity for the past seven days. These four tiles work on an hourly time window that indicates how many hours in the past seven days the corresponding metric was above 80%. This metric indicates a potential degradation for the end-user experience.

![Usage in 7 days](media/service-admin-premium-monitor-capacity/usage-in-days.png)

| **Metric** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| CPU |Number of times CPU exceeded 80% utilization. |
| Memory Thrashing |Represents the memory pressure on your backend cores. Specifically, this is a metric of how many times datasets are evicted from memory due to memory pressure from the usage of multiple datasets. |
| Memory Usage |Average memory usage, represented in gigabytes (GB). |
| DQ/s | Number of times Direct Query and Live Connections count exceeded 80% of the limit. <br> * We limit the total number of DirectQuery and live connection queries per second.* The limits are 30/s for P1, 60/s for P2 and 120/s for P3. * Direct Query and live connection queries count add to the above throttle. For example, if you have 15 DirectQueries and 15 live connections in a second, you hit your throttle<br>* This applies equally to on-premises and cloud connections. |

Metrics reflect utilization over the past week.  If you'd like to see a more detailed view of the metrics, you can do so by clicking any of the summary tiles.  This will take you to detailed charts for each of the metrics for your premium capacity. The following chart shows details for the CPU metric.

![Detailed usage chart CPU](media/service-admin-premium-monitor-capacity/premium-usage-detailed-chart-cpu.png)

These charts are summarized on an hourly basis for the past week, and can help isolate when you may have had specific performance-related events in your premium capacity.

You may also export the underlying data for any of the metrics to a csv file.  This export will give you detailed information in three minute intervals for each day of the past week.
