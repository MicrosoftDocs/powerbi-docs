# Monitor Premium capacities with the app

Monitoring your capacities is essential to making informed decisions on how best to utilize your Premium capacity resources. You can monitor capacities in the Admin portal or with the **Power BI Premium Capacity Metrics** app. This article describes using the Premium Capacity Metrics app. The app provides the most in-depth information into how your capacities are performing. For a higher level overview of average use metrics over the last seven days, you can use the Admin portal. To learn more about monitoring in the portal, see [Monitor Premium capacities in the Admin portal](service-admin-premium-monitor-portal.md).

The app is updated regularly with new features and functionality. Make sure you're running the latest version. If you have a previous version of the app already installed, it’s best to delete it from your apps and then press CTRL+F5 to refresh.

## Install the app

You can go straight to [Premium Capacity Metrics app](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/getapps/services/capacitymetrics), or install it like you do other apps in Power BI.

1. In Power BI, click **Apps**.

    ![Go to Apps](media/service-admin-premium-monitor-capacity/apps.png)

2. On the right side, click **Get apps**.
3. In the **Apps** category, search for **Power BI Premium Capacity Metrics app**.
4. Subscribe to install the app.

Be patient. It takes a few minutes to install and refresh metrics. If the app shows blank metrics, press F5 to refresh your browser.

## Get app refresh history

To check the last time your Premium Capacity Metrics app refreshed, click **Settings** > **Datasets** > **Power BI Premium Capacity Metrics** > **Refresh History**. 

![Refresh history in Settings](media/service-admin-premium-monitor-capacity/settings-refresh-history.png)

The last refresh is shown, or click **Refresh history** to see scheduled and on demand refreshes.

![Last refresh](media/service-admin-premium-monitor-capacity/settings-last-refresh.png)

## Monitor capacities with the app

Now that you've installed the app, you can see metrics for the capacities in your organization. The app provides a Dashboard with metrics summaries, and detailed metrics Reports.

### Dashboard

### Reports

Reports provide more detailed metrics. To see reports for capacities for which you are an admin, in **Reports**, click **Power BI Premium Capacity Metrics**. Or, from the dashboard, click a metric cell to go to the underlying report. 

At the bottom of the report, there are five *tabs*:

[**Datasets**](#datasets) - Provides detailed metrics on the health of the Power BI datasets in your capacities.
[**Paginated Reports**](#paginated-reports) - Provides detailed metrics on the health of the paginated reports in your capacities.
[**Dataflows**](#dataflows) - Provides detailed refresh metrics for dataflows in your capacities.
[**AI**](#ai) - Provides detailed metrics on the health of the AI functions used in your capacities.
[**Resource Consumption**](#resource-consumption) - Provides detailed resource metrics including memory and CPU high utilization.
[**IDs and Info**](#ids-and-info) - Names, IDs, and owners for capacities, workspaces, and workloads.

Each tab opens a page where you can filter metrics by capacity and date range. If no filters are selected, the report defaults to show the past week’s metrics for all capacities that are reporting metrics. 

### Datasets

The Datasets page has different *areas*, which include  **Refreshes**, **Query Durations**, **Query Waits**, and **Datasets**. Use the buttons at the top of the page to navigate to different areas.

#### Refreshes area

| Report section | Metrics |
| --- | --- |
| Refreshes |  Total Count: Total refreshes for each dataset.<br>  Reliability: The percentage of refreshes that completed for each dataset.<br>  Avg Wait Time: The average lag between the scheduled time and start of a refresh for the dataset, in minutes.<br>  Max Wait Time: The maximum wait time for the dataset, in minutes.<br>  Avg Duration: The average duration of refresh for the dataset, in minutes.<br>  Max Duration: The duration of the longest-running refresh for the dataset, in minutes. |
| Top 5 Datasets by Average Duration (minutes) |  The five datasets with the longest average refresh duration, in minutes. |

| Hourly Refresh Count and Memory Consumption (GB) |  Successes, failures, and memory consumption, split into one-hour buckets, reported in UTC time. |
| Hourly Average Refresh Wait Times (minutes) |  The average refresh wait time, split into one-hour buckets, reported in UTC time. Multiple spikes with high refresh wait times are indicative of the capacity running hot. |
|  |  |

#### Query Durations area

| Report section | Metrics |
| --- | --- |
| Query Durations |  Data in this section is sliced by datasets, workspace, and hourly buckets in the past seven days.<br>  Total: The total number of queries run for the dataset.<br>  Average: The average query duration for the dataset, in milliseconds<br>  Max: The duration of the longest-running query in the dataset, in milliseconds.|

|  |  |

#### Query Waits area

| Report section | Metrics |
| --- | --- |
| Query Wait Times |  Data in this section is sliced by datasets, workspace, and hourly buckets in the past seven days.<br>  Total: The total number of queries run for the dataset.<br>  Wait count: The number of queries in the dataset that waited on system resources before starting execution.<br>  Average: The average query wait time for the dataset, in milliseconds.<br>  Max: The duration of the longest-waiting query in the dataset, in milliseconds.|

| Hourly Loaded Dataset Counts |  Number of datasets loaded into memory vs. memory consumption in GB, split into one-hour buckets, reported in UTC time. |
| Hourly Dataset Evictions and Memory Consumption |  Dataset evictions vs. memory consumption in GB, split into one-hour buckets, reported in UTC time. |

## Monitor Power BI Embedded capacity

You can use the Power BI Premium Capacity Metrics app to monitor *A SKU* capacities in Power BI Embedded. Those capacities will show up in the report as long as you are an admin of the capacity. However, refresh of the report fails unless you grant certain permissions to Power BI on your A SKUs:

1. Open your capacity in the Azure portal.

1. Click **Access control (IAM)**, and then add the **Power BI Premium** app to the reader role. If you are unable to find the app by name, you can also add it by client identifier: `cb4dc29f-0bf4-402a-8b30-7511498ed654`.

    ![Permissions for Power BI Embedded](media/service-admin-premium-monitor-capacity/embedded-permissions.png)

> [!NOTE]
> You can monitor Power BI Embedded capacity usage in the app or the Azure portal, but not in the Power BI admin portal.
