# Create a QR code for a tile in Power BI to use in the mobile apps

[!INCLUDE [applies-no-desktop-yes-service-yes-mobile](../includes/applies-no-desktop-yes-service-yes-mobile.md)]

QR codes in Power BI can connect anything in the real world directly to related BI information&mdash;no navigation or search needed.

You can create a QR code in the Power BI service for tiles in any dashboard, even in dashboards you can't edit. You then place the QR code in a key location. For example, you could paste it in an email or print it out and place it in a specific location.

Colleagues you've shared the dashboard with can [scan the QR code for access to the tile](../consumer/mobile/mobile-apps-qr-code.md) right from their mobile device. The tile will open for them in focus mode.

## Create a QR code for a tile

1. Open a dashboard in the Power BI service.
1. Select **More options (...)** in the upper right corner of the tile you want to create a QR code for and choose **Open in focus mode**.

1. In focus mode, select **More options (...)** at the upper right and choose **Generate QR Code**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/service-create-qr-code-for-tile/power-bi-create-qr-code-tile-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a dashboard File menu, highlighting Generate QR code.":::

1. A dialog box with the QR code appears.

1. From here, you can scan the QR code or download and save it, so you can:

   * Add it to an email or other document.
   * Print it and place it in a specific location.

## Print the QR code

Power BI generates the QR code as a JPG file, ready to print.

1. Select **Download**, then open the JPG file on a computer connected to a printer.  

   > [!TIP]
   > The JPG file has the same name as the tile. For example, "Variance Plan %, Variance Latest Estimate % - Quarter 3.jpg".
   >
   >
2. Print the file at 100% or “actual size”.  
3. Cut out the QR code and glue it to a place relevant to the tile.
