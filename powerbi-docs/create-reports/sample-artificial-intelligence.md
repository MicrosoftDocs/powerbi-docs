# Artificial Intelligence sample for Power BI: Take a tour

The Artificial Intelligence sample contains a report for a fictitious company named Contoso. The Contoso sales manager created this report to understand their products and regions' key contributors for revenue won/loss, identify the highest or lowest breakdown of revenue, and determine if there are anomalies in their data. This sample is part of a series that shows how you can use Power BI with business-oriented data, reports, and dashboards.

## Explore the Artificial Intelligence sample report

The sample report has three pages, **Key Influencers**, **Decomposition Tree**, and **Anomaly Detection**, to demonstrate how people can discover new insights and inform their decision making with easy-to-use artificial intelligence visuals.

## Key Influencers page

The first report page to explore is **Key Influencers**, where you analyze your data to understand the effect and influence of key contributors on your results.

### What are your top contributors for wins and losses

1. Start by reviewing the top contributors that resulted in a **Status** of **Won** using the **Key influencers** visual in the center of your report. From the visual, notice that the top contributor is when the **Discount goes up 2%**, you're **2.76x** more likely to win new revenue.

1. Select the **2.76x** indicator. Power BI displays a scatter chart next to it, showing the correlation between your **Discount** and **% Status is Won** for this influencer.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-artificial-intelligence/power-bi-top-contributor.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Top contributor to revenue won.":::

1. As you interact with slicers, filters, and other visuals, the Key influencers visual reruns its analysis based on the updated choice. From the **Close % by Product category** stacked bar chart, select the **Furniture** category to generate new insights based upon the updated selection. You see that when the **Product category** is **Furniture** and when the **Sales owner** is **Molly Clark**, you're **1.50x** more likely to win new revenue.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-artificial-intelligence/power-bi-key-influencers-update.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Updated analysis for Key influencers.":::

1. To review the top contributors for when your **Status** changes, from the dropdown, select the **Lost** option to generate new insights based upon the updated selection. You can now answer the question, **â€œWhat is the top contributor when a loss occurs?"**

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-artificial-intelligence/power-bi-key-influencers-status-change.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Status change for Key influencers.":::

To learn more, see [Key influencers visuals](../visuals/power-bi-visualization-influencers.md).

## Decomposition Tree page

The second report page to explore is **Decomposition Tree**, where you conduct root cause and ad hoc analysis to understand the effect of **Sales Opportunities** across the different fields within your data.

### Who is the top sales owner and largest opportunity path for computer sales

1. From the **Decomposition tree** visual in the center of your report, select the **Computers** option within the **Category** breakdown to rerun the analysis.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-artificial-intelligence/power-bi-decomposition-selection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Decomposition tree rerun analysis.":::

1. With your updated analysis, you can use *artificial intelligence splits* to determine the path to the next highest sales opportunities in your data. Select the **+** symbol next to **Tablets** and the **High value** option.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-artificial-intelligence/power-bi-decomposition-ai-split.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Decomposition tree AI split path.":::

1. The tree determines that the **Territory** field as the next path for sales opportunity, with the **US-SOUTH** being the largest. Select the **+** symbol next to **US-SOUTH**, then select the **High value** option. From the updated selection, you can now answer the question, **"Who is the top sales owner?"**

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-artificial-intelligence/power-bi-decomposition-ai-split-sales-owner.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Decomposition tree AI split path to highest value.":::

To learn more, see [Decomposition tree visuals](../visuals/power-bi-visualization-decomposition-tree.md).

## Anomaly Detection page

The final report page to explore is **Anomaly Detection**, where you combine several artificial intelligence capabilities to detect anomalies in your results, generate dynamic text summaries, and use your own natural language to ask questions and get answers from your data.

### Why the sharp decline in software revenue

1. The clustered bar chart in the top right of the page is divided into multiple versions of itself (*small multiples*) to compare data across the **Manager** and **Product category** fields. In the **Software** multiple, select the bar for **Low, Spencer** to dynamically filter the rest of the page to Spencer's specific results.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-artificial-intelligence/power-bi-small-multiple.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Small multiple for Product category.":::

1. On the right side of the page, Power BI has generated a dynamic summary based on the updated selection. The text summary describes the highest and lowest calendar months for **Revenue Won**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-artificial-intelligence/power-bi-smart-narrative.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Smart narrative summary.":::

1. Within the line chart in the center of the page, right-click the **December 2020** data point. Within the menu options, select **Analyze** > **Explain the decrease** to answer **"Why the sharp decline in revenue in December 2020?"** using quick insights.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-artificial-intelligence/power-bi-quick-insights.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Quick insights to explain the decrease.":::

To learn more, see [Smart narratives](../visuals/power-bi-visualization-smart-narrative.md) and [Apply insights to explain fluctuations in visuals](desktop-insights.md).

### Why the unexpected increase in revenue over the last 90 days

1. In the top right of the page, select the **Last 90 days** to view **Revenue Won** displayed as individual days.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-artificial-intelligence/power-bi-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Power B I button selection.":::

1. The button has preserved the **Low, Spencer** and **Software** selections from earlier steps. It has also rewritten the **Revenue Summary** based upon the last 90 days filter, which you can review for new insights. In the line chart, there are also visual **anomaly** indicators. Select the **April 25th** indicator for a possible explanation as to **"Why?"** an anomaly was detected.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-artificial-intelligence/power-bi-anomaly-detection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Anomaly detection.":::

1. The **Anomalies** pane is now displayed on the right side of your report page. It includes **Possible explanations**, a **Strength score**, which means that higher scores might have had a greater effect, and possibly more explanations if you scroll down. From your highest possible explanation score, you can answer the question, **"Why the increase in revenue?"**. When finished, collapse the Anomalies pane using the double arrows **>>** at the top of the pane.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-artificial-intelligence/power-bi-anomalies-pane.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Anomalies pane.":::

To learn more, see [Anomaly detection](../visuals/power-bi-visualization-anomaly-detection.md).

### Which manager had the highest close percentage and in what month

1. In the bottom right of the page, type the question *close %* in the **Ask a question about your data** field to return a single value.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-artificial-intelligence/ask-a-question.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Ask a question.":::

2. To segment the **close %** results by month, modify the current question to *close % by month* to visually display the results in a clustered column chart.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-artificial-intelligence/ask-a-question-by-month.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Q and A segmented by month.":::

3. While columns can be great for comparing one item to another, they aren't as useful when displaying movement over time. Update the original text to *close % by month in a line chart*.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-artificial-intelligence/ask-a-question-by-month-line-chart.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Q and A in a line chart.":::

4. And to answer the question of **Which manager had the highest close percentage?** update the question to *close % by month in a line chart by manager* and compare the final results.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-artificial-intelligence/ask-a-question-by-month-line-chart-by-manager.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Q and A by manager.":::
