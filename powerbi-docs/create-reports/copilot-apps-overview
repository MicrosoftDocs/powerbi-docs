# Overview of Copilot for Power BI apps

Copilot is available in apps two ways: 
1. an app-scoped Copilot (preview) that can help users find items in the app based on their interests, summarize an item in the app, or answer questions based on items in the app. 
2. a report-scoped Copilot that can help users with summaries of the report in view or answer questions based on that report in view
