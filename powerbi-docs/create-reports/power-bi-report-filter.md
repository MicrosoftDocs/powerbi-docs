# Format filters in Power BI reports

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-yes-desktop-yes-service.md)]

You have control over report filter design and functionality. This article explains how you can format the Filters pane to look like the rest of the report. You can lock and even hide filters.

![Screenshot of the Power BI service Retail Analysis Sample.](media/power-bi-report-filter/power-bi-filter-new-look.png)

The first step is to [add filters to your report](power-bi-report-add-filter.md). Then as a report designer, there are many of ways you can format the Filters pane:

- Add and remove fields to filter.
- Change the filter state.
- Format and customize the Filters pane so that it appears like part of your report.
- Define whether the Filters pane is open or collapsed by default when a consumer opens the report.
- Hide the entire Filters pane or specific filters that you don't want report consumers to see.
- Control and even bookmark the visibility, open, and collapsed state of the Filters pane.
- Lock filters that you don't want consumers to edit.

Users can hover over any visual to see a read-only list of the filters or slicers affecting that visual.

Read about [how report readers use filters](../consumer/end-user-report-filter.md) in report Reading mode.

## Build the Filters pane

By default, the Filters pane is formatted based on your current report settings. In the Filters pane, you configure which filters to include and update existing filters. The Filters pane looks the same for your report consumers when you publish your report.

1. When you add a visual to a report canvas, Power BI automatically adds a filter to the Filters pane for each field in the visual.

2. To build your Filters pane, drag other fields of interest into the Filters pane either as visual, page, or report level filters.

## Show or hide the Filters pane

### Hide the Filters pane in Reading mode

If you don't want your report readers to see the Filters pane, select the **eye** icon next to **Filters**.

![Screenshot of the Filters pane, highlighting the eye icon.](media/power-bi-report-filter/power-bi-filter-eye.png)

### Hide the Filters pane while editing

You can hide the Filters pane while you're editing your report when you need extra space.

- On the **View** tab, **Filters** allows you to show or hide the Filters pane.

![Screenshot of the View tab, highlighting Filters.](media/power-bi-report-filter/power-bi-filter-hide.png)

This setting only hides the Filters pane in Power BI Desktop. There's no equivalent in Editing mode in the Power BI service.

## Lock or hide filters

You can lock or hide individual filter cards. If you lock a filter, your report consumers can see but not change it. If you hide the filter, they can't even see it. Hiding filter cards is typically useful if you need to hide data cleanup filters that exclude nulls or unexpected values.

- In the Filters pane, select or clear the **Lock filter** or **Hide filter** icons in a filter card.

   ![Screenshot of the Filters pane, highlighting the Hide and lock filters.](media/power-bi-report-filter/power-bi-filter-lock-hide.png)

As you turn these settings on and off in the Filters pane, you see the changes reflected in the report. Hidden filters don't show up in the pop-up filter list for a visual.

You can also configure the Filters pane state to flow with your report bookmarks. The pane's open, close, and visibility state are all bookmarkable.

## Format the Filters pane

A large part of the filter experience is that you can format the Filters pane to match the look and feel of your report. You can also format the Filters pane differently for each page in the report. Here are elements you can format:

- Background color
- Background transparency
- Border on or off
- Border color
- Title and header font, color, and text size

You can also format these elements for filter cards, depending on if they're applied (set to something) or available (cleared):

- Background color
- Background transparency
- Border: on or off
- Border color
- Font, color, and text size
- Input box color

### Format the Filters pane and cards

1. In the report, select the report itself or the background (*wallpaper*), then in the **Visualizations** pane, select **Format**.

   You see options for formatting the report page, the wallpaper, and the Filters pane and Filter cards.

1. Expand **Filters pane** to set color for the background, icon, and left border, to complement the report page.

    ![Screenshot that shows the Filters pane expanded under the Format icon in Power BI Desktop.](media/power-bi-report-filter/power-bi-desktop-format-filter-pane.png)

1. Expand **Filter cards** to set the **Default** and **Applied** color and border.
   If you make available and applied cards different colors, it's obvious which filters are applied.

## Theming for Filters pane

You can now modify the default settings of the Filters pane with the theme file. Here's a sample theme snippet to get you started:

â€¯
```
"outspacePane": [{
        "backgroundColor": {
            "solid": {
                "color": "#0000ff"
            }
        },
        "foregroundColor": {
            "solid": {
                "color": "#00ff00"
            }
        },
        "transparency": 50,
        "titleSize": 35,
        "headerSize": 8,
        "fontFamily": "Georgia",
        "border": true,
        "borderColor": {
            "solid": {
                "color": "#ff0000"
            }
        }
    }
], "filterCard": [{
        "$id": "Applied",
        "transparency": 0,
        "backgroundColor": {
            "solid": {
                "color": "#ff0000"
            }
        },
        "foregroundColor": {
            "solid": {
                "color": "#45f442"
            }
        },
        "textSize": 30,
        "fontFamily": "Arial",
        "border": true,
        "borderColor": {
            "solid": {
                "color": "#ffffff"
            }
        },
        "inputBoxColor": {
            "solid": {
                "color": "#C8C8C8"
            }
        }
    }, {
        "$id": "Available",
        "transparency": 40,
        "backgroundColor": {
            "solid": {
                "color": "#00ff00"
            }
        },
        "foregroundColor": {
            "solid": {
                "color": "#ffffff"
            }
        },
        "textSize": 10,
        "fontFamily": "Times New Roman",
        "border": true,
        "borderColor": {
            "solid": {
                "color": "#123456"
            }
        },
        "inputBoxColor": {
            "solid": {
                "color": "#777777"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

## Sort the Filters pane

Custom sort functionality is available in the Filters pane. When creating your report, you can drag and drop filters to rearrange them in any order.

![An animation of the Filters pane, showing filters being rearranged.](media/power-bi-report-filter/power-bi-filter-sort.gif)

The default sort order for filters is alphabetical. To start custom sort mode, drag any filter to a new position. You can only reorder filters within the level they apply to. For example, you can change the order of the visual-level filters within the visual-level section of the Filters pane.

## Improved Filters pane accessibility

We've improved the keyboard navigation for the Filters pane. You can tab through every part of the Filters pane and use the context key on your keyboard or **Shift+F10** to open the context menu.

![Screenshot of the Filters pane, showing the context menu.](media/power-bi-report-filter/power-bi-filter-accessible.png)

## Rename filters

When you're editing the Filters pane, you can double-click the title to edit it. Renaming is useful if you want to update the filter card to make more sense for your end users. Renaming the filter card doesn't rename the display name of the field in the fields list. Renaming the filter card just changes the display name used in the filter card.

![Screenshot of the Filters pane, highlighting the filter title.](media/power-bi-report-filter/power-bi-filter-rename.png)

## Filters pane search

The Filters pane search feature allows you to search across your filter cards by title. This feature is helpful if you have several different filter cards in your Filters pane and need to find a specific card.

![Screenshot of the Filters pane, with an example title entered.](media/power-bi-report-filter/power-bi-filter-search.png)

You can also format the search box, just as you can format the other elements of the Filters pane.

![Screenshot of the Filters pane, highlighting the option to format the search box.](media/power-bi-report-filter/power-bi-desktop-filter-format-search.png)

# [Power BI Desktop](#tab/powerbi-desktop)

While the Filters pane search feature is on by default, you can also choose to turn it on or off by selecting **Enable search for Filters pane** in the **Report** settings of the **Options** dialog.

![Screenshot of the Options menu, highlighting the Enable search for Filters pane.](media/power-bi-report-filter/power-bi-enable-search-filter.png)

# [Power BI service](#tab/powerbi-service)
While this Filters pane search feature is on by default, you can also choose to turn it on or off.
Select **File** > **Setting**, then select **Enable search for Filters pane**.

![Screenshot shows the option to Enable search for Filters pane.](media/power-bi-report-filter/power-bi-service-enable-search-filter.png)

## Restrict changes to filter type

# [Power BI Desktop](#tab/powerbi-desktop)

Under the **Filtering experience** section of **Report** settings, you can control if users can change the filter type.

![Screenshot of the Filtering experience section, highlighting Allow users to change filter types.](media/power-bi-report-filter/power-bi-enable-change-filter-type.png)

# [Power BI service](#tab/powerbi-service)

You can control if users can change the filter type.
Select **File** > **Setting**, then select **Allow users to change filter types**.

![Screenshot of the Filtering experience menu, highlighting Allow users to change filter types.](media/power-bi-report-filter/power-bi-service-enable-change-filter-type.png)

## Allow saving filters

By default, your report readers can save filters for your report. You can choose to not allow them to save filters.

# [Power BI Desktop](#tab/powerbi-desktop)

Also in **Report** settings of the **Options** dialog, under **Persistent filters**, select **Don't allow end users to save filters on this file in the Power BI service**.

:::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-report-filter/power-bi-persistent-filters.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Don't allow end users to save filters on this file in the Power BI service.":::

# [Power BI service](#tab/powerbi-service)

Select **File** > **Setting**. Under **Persistent filters**, select **Don't allow end users to save filters on this report**.

:::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-report-filter/power-bi-service-persistent-filters.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Persistent Filters dialog, showing Don't allow end users to save filters on this report.":::

## Apply filters button

In Power BI Desktop, you can add a single **Apply** button to the filter pane, allowing you and your end-users to apply all filter modifications at once. Having this button is useful if you want to defer applying filter changes. You only have to wait once, after you're ready to apply all the filter changes to the report or visuals.

:::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-report-filter/apply-filter-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Filters pane, showing the applied filters.":::

### Turn on the Apply button

You can set this feature at the report level, only in Power BI Desktop. However, the feature is off by default.

1. Go to **File** > **Options and settings** > **Options** > **Query reduction**.

1. Select **Add a single Apply button to the filter pane to apply changes at once**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-report-filter/apply-all-filters.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Options menu, highlighting Add a single Apply button to the filter pane to apply changes at once.":::

### Format the Apply button

Currently, you can control some of the formatting for the **Apply** text for the button. In the **Filter pane** section of the **Format** pane, set these options:

- Under **Text**
  - **Font** controls font family
  - **Text and icon color** controls text color.

- Under **Header**
  - **Header text size** controls text size.

## Considerations and limitations

Publish-to-web doesn't display the Filters pane. If you're planning to publish a report to the web, consider adding slicers for filtering instead.
