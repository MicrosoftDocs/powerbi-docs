# Retail Analysis sample for Power BI: Take a tour

> [!NOTE]
> For an updated version of this sample, see [Store Sales sample for Power BI: Take a tour](sample-store-sales.md).

The Retail Analysis built-in sample contains a dashboard, report, and semantic model that analyzes retail sales data of items sold across multiple stores and districts. The metrics compare this year's performance to last year's for sales, units, gross margin, variance, and new-store analysis.

:::image type="content" source="media/sample-retail-analysis/retail1.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the dashboard for the Retail Analysis sample." lightbox="media/sample-retail-analysis/retail1.png":::

This sample is part of a series that shows how you can use Power BI with business-oriented data, reports, and dashboards. The company [obviEnce](http://www.obvience.com/) created this sample using real, anonymized data. The data is available in several formats: built-in sample in the Power BI service, *.pbix* Power BI Desktop file, or Excel workbook. See [Samples for Power BI](sample-datasets.md).

This tutorial explores the Retail Analysis sample in the Power BI service. Because the report experience is similar in Power BI Desktop and in the service, you can also follow along by using the sample *.pbix* file in Power BI Desktop. Get the sample in one of the following ways:

- Get the [built-in sample in the service](#get-the-built-in-sample-in-the-power-bi-service).
- Download the [.pbix file](#get-the-pbix-file-for-this-sample).
- Download the [Excel workbook](#get-the-excel-workbook-for-this-sample).

## Prerequisites

You don't need a Power BI license to explore the samples in Power BI Desktop. You just need a [Fabric free license](../consumer/end-user-features.md) to explore the sample in the Power BI service, and save it to your **My workspace**.

## Get the built-in sample in the Power BI service

1. Open the Power BI service (`app.powerbi.com`), and select **Learn** in the left navigation.

1. On the **Learning center** page, under **Sample reports**, scroll until you see the **Retail Analysis Sample**.

1. Select the sample. It opens in Reading mode.

1. Power BI imports the built-in sample, adding a new dashboard, report, and semantic model to your current workspace.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-retail-analysis/retail-entry.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Retail Analysis Sample dashboard link.":::

   Select the dashboard to view the sample dashboard.

## Get the .pbix file for this sample

Alternatively, you can download the Retail Analysis sample as a [.pbix file](https://download.microsoft.com/download/9/6/D/96DDC2FF-2568-491D-AAFA-AFDD6F763AE3/Retail%20Analysis%20Sample%20PBIX.pbix), which is designed for use with Power BI Desktop.

1. After you open the file in Power BI Desktop, select **File** > **Publish** > **Publish to Power BI** or choose **Publish** in the **Home** ribbon.

1. In the **Publish to Power BI** dialog, choose a workspace and then **Select**.

1. In the Power BI service, in your workspace, scroll down to the **Retail Analysis Sample** report and select to open.

1. From the **More options** (...) menu, select **Pin to a dashboard**. Select **New dashboard**, enter a name, and choose **Pin live**.

The dashboard that you create this way isn't the same as the sample dashboard created by the built-in sample. You can still [use Q&A in the dashboard](#use-qa-to-dig-deeper-in-the-dashboard) to learn more about your data and make changes to your dashboard.

## Get the Excel workbook for this sample

If you want to view the data source for this sample, it's also available as an Excel workbook. To see the raw data, enable the Data Analysis add-ins, and then select **Power Pivot** > **Manage**.

If you want to get and use the Excel file in the Power BI service, follow these steps:

1. Download the sample from [Power BI Desktop samples](https://github.com/microsoft/powerbi-desktop-samples/tree/main/powerbi-service-samples). The file is called *Retail Analysis Sample-no-PV.xlsx*.

1. Open the file in Excel and then select **File** > **Publish** > **Publish to Power BI**.

1. Select a workspace, such as **My workspace**, and choose **Export**.

   There are different ways to work with Excel files. For more information, see [Explore the Excel samples in Excel](sample-datasets.md#explore-excel-samples-in-excel).

1. In the Power BI service, the exported data appears as a semantic model in the selected workspace. Select **More options** (...) > **Auto-create report**.

1. Select **Save**, enter a name for your report, and then choose **Save**.

1. From the **More options** (...) menu, select **Pin to a dashboard**. Select **New dashboard**, enter a name, and choose **Pin live**.

The dashboard and report that you create this way aren't the same as the ones created by the built-in sample. You can still [use Q&A in the dashboard](#use-qa-to-dig-deeper-in-the-dashboard) to explore your data and make changes to your dashboard.

## Use Q&A to dig deeper in the dashboard

No matter whether you downloaded the dashboard or created your own, you can use Q&A in the dashboard to discover other details in the data. Let's try it.

1. On the dashboard, select the **This Year's Sales New & Existing Stores** tile.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-retail-analysis/pbi_sample_retanlthisyrsales.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows This Year's Sales tile.":::

   If your dashboard doesn't have that tile, type *This year sales* in the Q&A question box at the top of the dashboard. The Q&A results appear:

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-retail-analysis/retail7.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows This year's sales in Q&A tile.":::

1. Change the question to *this year's sales **by district***. Observe the result. Q&A automatically places the answer in a bar chart:

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-retail-analysis/retail8.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows This year's sales by district in Q&A results.":::

1. Now change the question to *this year's sales **by zip and chain***.

   Power BI answers the question as you type and displays the appropriate chart.

1. Experiment with more questions and see what kind of results you get.

1. When you're ready, return to the dashboard.

## Explore the report

If you got the [built-in report in the Power BI service](#get-the-built-in-sample-in-the-power-bi-service) or you published the [*.pbix* file from Power BI Desktop](#get-the-pbix-file-for-this-sample), your report corresponds to the sample in this section. If you [imported from Excel](#get-the-excel-workbook-for-this-sample), your automatically generated report won't look as described.

### Store Sales Overview page

1. If you got the built-in report in the Power BI service, in the workspace where you saved the sample, open the **Retail Analysis Sample** dashboard. On the dashboard, select the **Total Stores New & Existing Stores** tile, which opens to the **Store Sales Overview** page in the Retail Analysis Sample report.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-retail-analysis/retail-analysis-7.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Total Stores tile.":::  

    If you published the *.pbix* file from Power BI Desktop, open the **Store Sales Overview** page of the report. 
    
    On this report page, you see we have a total of 104 stores, 10 of which are new. We have two chains, Fashions Direct and Lindseys. Fashions Direct stores are larger, on average.

1. In the **This Year Sales by Chain** pie chart, select **Fashions Direct**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-retail-analysis/retail3.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows This Year Sales by Chain chart.":::  

   Notice the result in the **Total Sales Variance %** bubble chart:

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-retail-analysis/pbi_sample_retanlbubbles.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Total Sales Variance % chart.":::  

   The **FD-01** district has the highest average **Sales per Square Foot** and FD-02 has the lowest **Total Sales Variance** compared to last year. FD-03 and FD-04 are worst performers overall.

1. Select individual bubbles or other charts to see cross highlighting, revealing the effect of your selections.

1. To return to the dashboard, select  **Retail Analysis Sample** from the left navigation bar.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-retail-analysis/power-bi-breadcrumbs.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Navigation bar.":::

### Explore the District Monthly Sales page

Let's explore on a more detailed level, looking at the districts' performances.

1. On the dashboard, select the **This Year's Sales, Last Year's Sales** tile, which opens the **District Monthly Sales** page of the report.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-retail-analysis/pbi_sample_retanlareacht.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows This Year's Sales, Last Year's Sales tile.":::

    If you published the *.pbix* file from Power BI Desktop, open the **District Monthly Sales** page of the report.

    In the **Total Sales Variance % by Fiscal Month** chart, notice the large variability on variance % compared to last year, with January, April, and July being particularly bad months.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-retail-analysis/pbi_sample_retanlsalesvarcol.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Total Sales Variance % by Fiscal Month chart.":::

   Let's see if we can narrow down where the issues might be.

1. In the bubble chart, select the **020-Mens** bubble.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-retail-analysis/retail11.png" alt-text="Screenshot show the 020-Mens option selected." lightbox="media/sample-retail-analysis/retail11.png":::  

   The men's category wasn't as severely affected in April as the overall business. January and July were still problematic months.

1. Select the **010-Womens** bubble.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-retail-analysis/retail12.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the 010-Womens option selected."  lightbox="media/sample-retail-analysis/retail12.png":::

   The women's category performed much worse than the overall business across all months, and in almost every month compared to the previous year.

1. Select the bubble again to clear the filter.

### Try out the slicer

Let's look at how specific districts are doing.

1. Select **Allan Guinot** in the **District Manager** slicer on the top left.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-retail-analysis/retail13.png" alt-text="Screenshot show the district manager Allan Guinot selected." lightbox="media/sample-retail-analysis/retail13.png":::

   Allan's district outperformed in March and June, compared to last year.

1. With **Allan Guinot** still selected, select the **Womens-10** bubble in the bubble chart.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-retail-analysis/power-bi-allan.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Allan Guinot and Womens-10 selected.":::

   For the Womens-10 category, Allan's district didn't meet last year's volume.

1. Explore the other district managers and categories; what other insights can you find?

1. When you're ready, return to the dashboard.

### What the data says about sales growth this year

The last area we want to explore is our growth by examining the new stores opened this year.

1. Select the **Stores Opened This Year by Open Month, Chain** tile, which opens the **New Stores Analysis** page of the report.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-retail-analysis/retail15.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the New Stores Analysis page." lightbox="media/sample-retail-analysis/retail15.png":::

    Or open the **New Stores Analysis** page of the report.

    As evident from the tile, more Fashions Direct stores than Lindseys stores opened this year.
1. Observe the **Sales Per Sq Ft by Name** chart:

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-retail-analysis/retail14.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Sales Per Sq Ft by Name chart.":::

   Notice the difference in average sales/square foot across the new stores.

1. Select the **Fashions Direct** legend item in the **Open Store Count by Open Month and Chain** top-right chart. Notice, even for the same chain, the best store (Winchester Fashions Direct) significantly outperforms the worst store (Cincinnati 2 Fashions Direct) by $21.22 vs $12.86, respectively.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-retail-analysis/power-bi-lindseys.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows sales with Fashions Direct selected.":::

1. Select **Winchester Fashions Direct** in the **Name** slicer and observe the line chart. The first sales numbers were reported in February.

1. Select **Cincinnati 2 Fashions Direct** in the slicer and observe in the line chart that it opened in June and appears to be the worst performing store.

1. Explore by selecting other bars, lines, and bubbles throughout the charts and see what insights you can discover.
