# Overview of accessibility in Power BI

When working with Power BI, consider the different types of users who might interact with your reports. You can create reports that are easy to navigate and understand for keyboard or screen reader users. Such reports enable users who might have visual or physical impairments to benefit from your reports.

For example, the following image shows a Power BI report displayed in high-contrast mode, with yellow text and visuals on a black background. This setting improves readability for users with visual impairments.

This article provides an overview of Power BI and accessibility. Other articles provide guidance and tools to help you create great reports with accessibility in mind.

## Universal design

Universal design is the design of products that are usable by as many people as reasonably possible, without the need for special adaptation or specialized design. When creating reports or experiences in Power BI, consider the needs of your users. Designing an accessible experience doesn't only benefit your end users who might have hearing, motor, cognitive, or visual impairments. It can also help all the end users in your organization. Power BI gives you the tools to make and consume accessible reports. As a report creator, use those tools to improve everyone's experience.

## Accessibility standards

Power BI is committed to the following accessibility standards. The standards help ensure that your Power BI experiences are accessible to as many people as possible. When you build accessible reports or dashboards, that content is accessible for anyone who views them by using Power BI Mobile.

### WCAG 2.1

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) help make web content accessible to people with disabilities. The following are key principles of the guidelines:

- **Perceivable**: Users must be able to perceive information and user interface components.
- **Operable**: Users must be able to operate user interface components and navigation.
- **Understandable**: Users must be able to understand information and the operation of the user interface.
- **Robust**: Content can be interpreted by a wide range of user agents, including assistive technologies.

### US Accessibility Conformance

US Accessibility Conformance requires governments and federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities.

### EN 301 549

EN 301 549 is the Harmonized European Standard for Accessibility requirements for Information and Communication Technology (ICT) products and services.

### Conformance documentation

To find updated conformance reports, search for Power BI in the [Microsoft Accessibility Conformance Portal](https://www.microsoft.com/accessibility/conformance-reports).
