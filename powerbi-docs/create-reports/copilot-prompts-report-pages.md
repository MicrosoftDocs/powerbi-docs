# Write Copilot prompts for creating report pages in Power BI

[!INCLUDE [applies-no-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-no-desktop-yes-service.md)]

Before your business can start using Copilot capabilities in Power BI, your administrator needs to [enable Copilot in Microsoft Fabric](/fabric/get-started/copilot-fabric-overview#enable-copilot).

[!INCLUDE [copilot-notes](../includes/copilot-notes.md)]

## Sample prompts for report pages

Here are some examples of prompts that work well with Copilot for Power BI. Use these prompts as examples.

Each sample prompt is paired with a report page that Copilot generated based on the interpretation of that prompt. Your prompts help Copilot understand what you're looking for, but they may not produce a page that's exactly what you want. It's a starting point for report page creation. Use the user interface to modify the report page that Copilot created. 

Also, see the [Considerations and limitations section](copilot-create-report.md#considerations-and-limitations) in the article "Create report pages with Copilot for the Power BI service."

## Sales performance by product
