# Write Copilot prompts for creating report pages in Power BI

[!INCLUDE [applies-no-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-no-desktop-yes-service.md)]

Before your business can start using Copilot capabilities in Power BI, your administrator needs to [enable Copilot in Microsoft Fabric](/fabric/get-started/copilot-fabric-overview#enable-copilot).

## Sample prompts for report pages

Here are some examples of prompts that work well with Copilot for Power BI. Use these prompts as examples.

Each sample prompt is paired with a report page that Copilot generated based on the interpretation of that prompt. Your prompts help Copilot understand what you're looking for, but they may not produce a page that's exactly what you want. It's a starting point for report page creation. Use the user interface to modify the report page that Copilot created. 

## Sales performance by product

"Create a page to analyze the sales amount, revenue, and profit margin of different products, categories, and subcategories over time and across regions."

## Customer segmentation and loyalty

"Create a page to identify and compare the characteristics, behaviors, and preferences of different customer segments based on demographic, geographic, and transactional data."

### Create a table of contents

Now generate a table of contents across your report pages. 

"Make a table of contents for this report that contains a brief description of what each page is about."
