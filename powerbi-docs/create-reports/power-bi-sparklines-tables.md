# Create sparklines in a table or matrix in a Power BI report (preview)

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-yes-desktop-yes-service.md)]

A good way to add meaning to a table or matrix is to add *sparklines*. Sparklines are tiny charts shown within cells of a table or matrix that make it easy to see and compare trends quickly. Sparklines are currently in preview. You can use them to show trends in a series of values, such as seasonal increases or decreases, economic cycles, or to highlight max and min values.

## Turn on the sparklines preview

Sparklines should be on by default. If you don't see the option to add them, here's how to turn on the feature.

- In Power BI Desktop, go to **File** > **Options and settings** > **Options** > **Preview features**, and select **Sparklines**.

Watch this video showing how to add sparklines, and then try it yourself.

## Add a sparkline

After you enable the preview feature, you can add sparklines to both your table and matrix visuals. 

1. Create a table or matrix.
1. Select the dropdown arrow next to one of the numeric fields, and select **Add a sparkline**.

1. In the dialog box, you configure the details of your sparkline. The numeric field you started with is prepopulated for the **Y-axis**. You can change both the field and **Summarization** type, if needed. You also need to select a field, typically a date field, to use as the **X-axis** of the sparkline.

1. Select **Create**. The sparkline is automatically added to your table or matrix as a new column.

## Edit the sparkline

Now you can edit the sparklineâ€™s properties.

1. Select the dropdown arrow next to sparkline, and select **Edit sparkline**.

1. In the **Sparklines** card in the **Format** pane, modify the sparkline line and marker formatting. Change the line color and width, add markers for different value types (highest, first, last, and so on), and change the marker size, color, and shape.

1. The **Format** pane is also where you change the chart type from a line to a column chart.

## Considerations and limitations

- Power BI supports up to five sparklines per visual, and displays up to 52 points per sparkline.
- For performance reasons, the maximum number of columns in a matrix is also limited to 20 when sparklines are on.
- Sparklines are supported on Azure Analysis Services, but currently not supported on on-premises SQL Server Analysis Services.
- Visuals with sparklines don't support pinning to a dashboard.
