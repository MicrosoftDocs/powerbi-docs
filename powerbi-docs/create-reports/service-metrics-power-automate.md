# Use Power Automate to update goals automatically

Many organizations want to use scorecards in processes that help them achieve results more quickly. However, manually monitoring scorecards can be resource intensive and error prone. In this documentation, we go over how you automate business processes when important changes happen within your scorecard. It helps organization quickly respond to changing conditions by keeping everyone up to date, and taking automated actions to improve outcomes. This new capability is easy to use: You launch Power Automate right from your scorecard and immediately construct your automated flow.

## Create a flow

1. On the **Metrics** hub page, select the scorecard you want to update.

1. Select the **Create a flow** button in the ribbon.
