# Use Power Automate to update metrics automatically

Many organizations want to use scorecards in processes that help them achieve results more quickly. However, manually monitoring scorecards can be resource intensive and error prone. In this documentation, we go over how you automate business processes when important changes happen within your scorecard. It helps organization quickly respond to changing conditions by keeping everyone up to date, and taking automated actions to improve outcomes. This new capability is easy to use: You launch Power Automate right from your scorecard and immediately construct your automated flow.

## Get started

1. On the **Metrics** hub page, select the **Scorecards** tab.

1. Select the scorecard you want to update.

1. Then, select the **Create a flow** button in the ribbon.

## Actions and triggers

For now, we're offering standalone actions and triggers. To get started, select **Create your own flow**, search for *Power BI* in the connector search area, and select **Power BI**.

### Actions

The following is a list of actions:

- Create a goal (Preview)
- Create a check-in (Preview)
- Add a note to a check-in (Preview)
- Create a scorecard (Preview)
- Update a check-in (Preview)
- Update a goal (Preview)
- Get scorecards (Preview)
- Get goal check-ins (Preview)

### Triggers

- When a goal changes, for example, the status of the goal.
- When someone adds or edits a check-in.
- When an owner is assigned to a goal.
- When a data refresh for a goal fails.

From here, you can create and customize your flows to help automate business processes related to your scorecards. Using Power Automate with your Power BI metrics helps your teams and organization respond more quickly to changing conditions, and use data to take better actions.

## Templates

Templates will allow you to choose a flow that matches your complex business scenarios, and ensure you have the building blocks to automate your process. Templates will be rolling out in the coming weeks. We'll update the documentation then. A sneak peek at just a few of the scenarios we'll be enabling:  
  
- Triggering a teams notification when a status changes to *behind* or *at risk*.  
- Sending reminders to team members at specific intervals with links to scorecards or metrics to review.
- Notifying a specific team member when they're assigned to a new metric and should perform a check-in.
- Sending a Forms survey that gets added as a check-in note on a metric at a specified interval.
- Sending a congratulations email when a team completes a goal.
