# Introduction to dashboards for Power BI designers

[!INCLUDE [applies-no-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-no-desktop-yes-service.md)]

A Power BI *dashboard* is a single page, often called a canvas, that tells a story through visualizations. Because it's limited to one page, a well-designed dashboard contains only the highlights of that story. Readers can view related reports for the details.

Dashboards are a feature of the Power BI service. They're not available in Power BI Desktop. You can't create dashboards on mobile devices, but you can [view and share](../consumer/mobile/mobile-apps-view-dashboard.md) them there.

## Dashboard basics

The visualizations you see on the dashboard are called *tiles*. You *pin* tiles to a dashboard from reports, and each report is based on a semantic model. A dashboard is an introduction to the underlying reports and semantic models. Selecting a visualization takes you to the report and semantic model that it's based on. If you're new to Power BI, see [Basic concepts for designers in the Power BI service](../fundamentals/service-basic-concepts.md).

You can pin many kinds of tiles to dashboards:

- Pin a [tile from a report](service-dashboard-create.md).
- Pin a [tile from another dashboard](service-pin-tile-to-another-dashboard.md).
- Pin a [tile from Excel](service-dashboard-pin-tile-from-excel.md).
- Create a [tile in Q&A and pin it](service-dashboard-pin-tile-from-q-and-a.md).
- Pin an [entire report page](service-dashboard-pin-live-tile-from-report.md).
- Add [images, videos, and more](service-dashboard-add-widget.md) to a dashboard.

## Advantages of dashboards

Dashboards are a way to monitor your business and see all your most important metrics at a glance. The visualizations on a dashboard can come from one underlying semantic model or many, and from one underlying report or many. A dashboard combines on-premises and cloud data, providing a consolidated view of data.

A dashboard isn't just a pretty picture. It's highly interactive, and the tiles update as the underlying data changes.

## Who can create a dashboard?

The ability to create a dashboard is considered a *creator* feature and requires edit permissions on the report. Edit permissions are available to report creators and to colleagues the creator grants access to. For example, if a coworker creates a report in workspace ABC and adds you as a member of that workspace, you and your coworker both have edit permissions. On the other hand, if a report has been shared with you directly or as part of a [Power BI app](../collaborate-share/service-create-distribute-apps.md), you're *consuming* the report. You may not be able to pin tiles to a dashboard.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need a [Power BI Pro](../fundamentals/service-features-license-type.md) or Premium Per User (PPU) license to create dashboards in workspaces. You can create dashboards in your own My Workspace without a Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) license.

## Dashboards versus reports


[Reports](../consumer/end-user-reports.md) and dashboards seem similar because they're both canvases filled with visualizations, but there are major differences, as you can see in the following table.

| **Capability** | **Dashboards** | **Reports** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pages | One page | One or more pages |
| Data sources | One or more reports and one or more semantic models per dashboard | A single semantic model per report |
| Drilling down in visuals | Only if you [pin an entire report page](service-dashboard-pin-live-tile-from-report.md) to a dashboard. | Yes |
| Available in Power BI Desktop | No | Yes. You can build and view reports in Power BI Desktop. |
| Filtering | No. You can't filter or slice a dashboard. You can filter a [dashboard tile in focus mode](../consumer/end-user-focus.md#work-in-focus-mode), but can't save the filter. | Yes. There are many different ways to filter, highlight, and slice. |
| [Feature content on colleagues' Home page](../collaborate-share/service-featured-content.md#feature-a-dashboard-or-report)  | Yes | Yes |
| Favorites | Yes. You can set multiple dashboards as *favorites*. | Yes. You can set multiple reports as *favorites*. |
| Natural language queries (Q&A) | Yes | Yes, provided you have edit permissions for the report and underlying semantic model. |
| Set alerts | Yes. Available for dashboard tiles in certain circumstances. | No |
| Subscribe | Yes. You can subscribe to a dashboard. | Yes. You can subscribe to a report page. |
| See underlying semantic model tables and fields | No. You can't see tables and fields in the dashboard itself, but you can export data. | Yes |
