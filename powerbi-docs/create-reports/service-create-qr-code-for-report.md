# Create a QR code for a report in Power BI to use in the mobile apps

[!INCLUDE [applies-no-desktop-yes-service-yes-mobile](../includes/applies-no-desktop-yes-service-yes-mobile.md)]

QR codes in Power BI can connect anything in the real world directly to related BI information&mdash;no navigation or search needed.

You can create a QR code in the Power BI service for any report, even for a report you can't edit. Then you place the QR code in a key location. For example, you could paste it in an email or print it out and place it in a specific location.

Colleagues can scan the QR code for access to the report, right from [their mobile device](../consumer/mobile/mobile-apps-qr-code.md). They can also [scan a report QR code with the Power BI for Mixed Reality app](../consumer/mobile/mobile-hololens2-app.md#open-reports-with-qr-codes).

The Power BI mobile app supports QR codes with URLs query parameters, so you can create URLs with query parameters that will filter report data when the report opens. The QR code generated by the built-in Power BI QR code generator described in this article doesn't support URL query parameters. To create a QR code with URL query parameters, use an external generator.

## Create a QR code for a report

1. Open a report in the Power BI service.
1. Select **File** > **Generate a QR code**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/service-create-qr-code-for-report/power-bi-create-qr-code-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a report, highlighting File and Generate a QR code.":::
1. A dialog box with the QR code appears.

   :::image type="content" source="media/service-create-qr-code-for-report/powerbi-report-qrcode-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a dialog, showing the QR code is ready to download or save.":::
1. From here, you can scan the QR code or download and save it so you can:

   * Add it to an email or other document.
   * Print it and place it in a specific location.

## Print the QR code

Power BI generates the QR code as a JPG file, ready to print.

1. Select **Download**, then open the JPG file on a computer connected to a printer.

   The JPG file has the same name as the report. For example, "Best states for sunglass sales.jpg".

1. Print the file at 100% or “actual size”.
1. Cut out the QR code along its edge and glue it to a place relevant to the report.

## Limitations

The QR code generated by the built-in Power BI QR code generator described in this article doesn't support URL query parameters. To create a QR code with URL query parameters, use an external generator.
