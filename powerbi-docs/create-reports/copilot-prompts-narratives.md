# Write Copilot prompts to create narrative visuals in Power BI

[!INCLUDE [applies-no-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-no-desktop-yes-service.md)]

If you have edit permission for a report, Copilot can create a narrative visual for you on the report page. If you don't have edit permission, you can still use Copilot to get insights about the report by asking questions in the Copilot pane. See the article [Summarize your report content in the Copilot pane](copilot-pane-summarize-content.md) for details. 

[!INCLUDE [copilot-notes](../includes/copilot-notes.md)]

## Sample prompts for narrative visuals

Here are examples of prompts that work well for creating narrative visuals with Copilot for Power BI. Each sample prompt is paired with the narrative that Copilot generated. Your prompts help Copilot understand what you're looking for, but they might not produce exactly what you want on the first try. You can refine narratives by using follow-up prompts to adjust the tone, formatting, or content.

### Generate a focused narrative from scratch

Start by creating a narrative focused on one aspect of your data.

**Prompt**: "Generate a summary focused on tourism in Hawaii."

### Refine an existing narrative

Once you have a narrative, you can modify it with additional prompts. The following examples show how to iteratively improve a narrative using the suggested prompt as a starting point:

**Prompt**: "Shorten this summary and make the key information bold."

:::image type="content" source="media/copilot-prompts/shortened-summary.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing shortened summary with bold key information." lightbox="media/copilot-prompts/shortened-summary.png":::

**Prompt**: "Make the first bullet point about length of stay."

:::image type="content" source="media/copilot-prompts/length-of-stay-summary.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing summary with length of stay as first bullet point." lightbox="media/copilot-prompts/length-of-stay-summary.png":::

**Prompt**: "Add the question 'What are the factors that influence customer retention and return rate?'"

:::image type="content" source="media/copilot-prompts/modified-question-prompt.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing narrative with added question about customer retention factors." lightbox="media/copilot-prompts/modified-question-prompt.png":::

### Analyze specific relationships in your data

Create narratives that investigate specific aspects of your report.

**Prompt**: "Generate a summary explaining the relationship between revenue, location, and primary interest."
