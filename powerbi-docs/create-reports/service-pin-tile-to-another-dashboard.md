# Pin a tile from one dashboard to another dashboard

[!INCLUDE [applies-no-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-no-desktop-yes-service.md)]

One way to add a new [dashboard tile](../consumer/end-user-tiles.md) to a dashboard is to copy it from another dashboard. When you select either of these tiles, it links back to where it was created&mdash;either in Q&A or a report.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't pin tiles from shared dashboards.

## Prerequisites

- You just need a [Fabric free license](../consumer/end-user-features.md) to edit dashboards in My Workspace in the Power BI service.
- You need a Power BI Pro license to edit dashboards in other workspaces in the Power BI service. Read more about [Power BI Pro licenses](../fundamentals/service-self-service-signup-purchase-for-power-bi.md).
- You also need at least a Contributor role in that workspace. Read more about [roles in workspaces](../collaborate-share/service-roles-new-workspaces.md).
- If you want to follow along, get the [IT Spend Analysis sample](sample-it-spend.md#get-the-built-in-sample) in the Power BI service.

## Pin a tile to another dashboard

1. Open the IT Spend Analysis sample dashboard.
1. Hover over the tile you want to pin, select **More options (...)**, then select **Pin tile**.

1. Pin the tile to an existing dashboard or to a new dashboard.

   * **Existing dashboard**: select the name of the dashboard from the dropdown.
   * **New dashboard**: enter the name of the new dashboard.

1. Select **Pin**.

1. If this dashboard doesn't yet have a sensitivity label, Power BI prompts you to specify one.

1. A Success message near the top right corner lets you know the visualization was pinned to the selected dashboard.
