# Apply conditional formatting in tables and matrixes

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-yes-desktop-yes-service.md)]

With conditional formatting for tables and matrixes in Power BI, you can specify customized cell colors, including color gradients, based on field values. You can also represent cell values with data bars or KPI icons, or as active web links. You can apply conditional formatting to any text or data field, as long as you base the formatting on a field that has numeric, color name or hex code, or web URL values.

To apply conditional formatting, select a **Table** or **Matrix** visualization in Power BI Desktop or the Power BI service. In the **Visualizations** pane, right-click or select the down-arrow next to the field in the **Values** well that you want to format. Select **Conditional formatting**, and then select the type of formatting to apply.

![Conditional formatting menu](media/desktop-conditional-table-formatting/table-formatting-0-popup-menu.png)

To remove conditional formatting from a visualization, select **Remove conditional formatting** from the field's drop-down menu, and then select the type of formatting to remove.

![Screenshot of the remove option in conditional formatting menu.](media/desktop-conditional-table-formatting/table-formatting-1-remove.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Conditional formatting overrides any custom background or font color you apply to the conditionally formatted cell.

The following sections describe each conditional formatting option. You can combine more than one option in a single table column.

## Format background or font color

To format cell background or font color, select **Conditional formatting** for a field, and then select either **Background color** or **Font color** from the drop-down menu.

![Background color or Font color in conditional formatting menu](media/desktop-conditional-table-formatting/table-formatting-1-color-by-rules-dialog.png)

The **Background color** or **Font color** dialog box opens, with the name of the field you're formatting in the title. After selecting conditional formatting options, select **OK**.

![Conditional formatting dialog for Background color and Font color](media/desktop-conditional-table-formatting/table-formatting-2-diverging.png)

The **Background color** and **Font color** options are the same, but affect the cell background color and font color, respectively. You can apply the same or different conditional formatting to a field's font color and background color. If you make a field's font and background the same color, the font blends into the background so the table column shows only the colors.

## Color by color scale

To format cell background or font color by color scale, in the **Format style** field of the **Background color** or **Font color** dialog box, select **Gradient**. Under **What field should we based this on?**, select the field to base the formatting on. You can base the formatting on the current field, or on any field in your model that has numerical or color data.

Under **Summarization**, specify the aggregation type you want to use for the selected field. Under **Default formatting**, select a formatting to apply to blank values.

Under **Minimum** and **Maximum**, choose whether to apply the color scheme based on the lowest and highest field values, or on custom values you enter. Select the drop-down and select the colors swatches you want to apply to the minimum and maximum values. Select the **Add a middle color** check box to also specify a **Center** value and color.

An example table with color scale background formatting on the **Affordability** column looks like this:

![Example table with Gradient color scale applied to cell background.](media/desktop-conditional-table-formatting/table-formatting-1-apply-color-to.png)

The example table with color scale font formatting on the **Affordability** column looks like this:

![Example table with Gradient color scale applied to font color.](media/desktop-conditional-table-formatting/table-formatting-2-table.png)

## Color by rules

To format cell background or font color by rules, in the **Format style** field of the **Background color** or **Font color** dialog box, select **Rules**. Again, **What field should we base this on?** shows the field to base the formatting on, and **Summarization** shows the aggregation type for the field.

Under **Rules**, enter one or more value ranges, and set a color for each one. Each value range has an *If value* condition, an *and* value condition, and a color. Cell backgrounds or fonts in each value range are colored with the given color. The following example has three rules:

![Conditional formatting dialog for background color by rules: format style dropdown option is set to rules.](media/desktop-conditional-table-formatting/table-formatting-1-color-by-rules-if-value.png)

When you select **Percent** in this dropdown, youâ€™re setting the rule boundaries as a percent of the overall range of values from minimum to maximum. So, for example, if the lowest data point was 100 and the highest was 400, the above rules would color any point less than 200 as green, anything from 200 to 300 as yellow, and anything above 300 as red.

An example table with rules-based background color formatting based on **Percent** in the **Affordability** column looks like this:

![Example table with conditional color by rules applied.](media/desktop-conditional-table-formatting/table-formatting-1-color-by-rules-table.png)

### Color by rules for percentages

If the field the formatting is based on contains percentages, write the numbers in the rules as decimals, which are the actual values; for example, ".25" instead of "25". Also, select **Number** instead of **Percent** for the number format. For example, "If value is greater than or equal to 0 Number and is less than .25 Number" returns values less than 25%. 

![Conditional formatting dialog for background color by rules for percentages: format style dropdown option is set to rules.](media/desktop-conditional-table-formatting/power-bi-percent-conditional-rules.png)

In this example table with rules-based background color on the **% revenue region** column, 0 to 25% is red, 26% to 41% is yellow, and 42% and more is blue:

![Example table with color by rules for percentages applied.](media/desktop-conditional-table-formatting/power-bi-percent-conditional-table.png)

> [!NOTE]
> If you use **Percent** instead of **Number** for fields containing percentages, you may get unexpected results. In the above example, in a range of percent values from 21.73% to 44.36%, 50% of that range is 33%. So use **Number** instead.

## Color by color values

If you have a field or measure with color name or hex value data, you can use conditional formatting to automatically apply those colors to a column's background or font color. You can also use custom logic to apply colors to the font or background.

The field can use any color values listed in the CSS color spec at [https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-3/](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-3/). These color values can include:

- 3, 6 or 8-digit hex codes, for example #3E4AFF. Make sure you include the # symbol at the start of the code.
- RGB or RGBA values, like RGBA(234, 234, 234, 0.5).
- HSL or HSLA values, like HSLA(123, 75%, 75%, 0.5).
- Color names, such as Green, SkyBlue, or PeachPuff.

The following table has a color name associated with each state:

![State table with color names as a column](media/desktop-conditional-table-formatting/conditional-table-formatting_01.png)

To format the **Color** column based on its field values, select **Conditional formatting** for the **Color** field, and then select **Background color** or **Font color**. 

In the **Background color** or **Font color** dialog box, select **Field value** from the **Format style** drop-down field.

![Dialog of Format style for background color of color column: Format style drop down is set to Field value](media/desktop-conditional-table-formatting/conditional-table-formatting_02.png)

An example table with color field value-based **Background color** formatting on the **Color** field looks like this:

![Example table with background formatting by field value applied.](media/desktop-conditional-table-formatting/conditional-table-formatting_03.png)

If you also use **Field value** to format the column's **Font color**, the result is a solid color in the **Color** column:

![Example table with format background and font by field value applied.](media/desktop-conditional-table-formatting/conditional-table-formatting_04.png)

## Color based on a calculation

You can create a calculation that outputs different values based on business logic conditions you select. Creating a formula is usually faster than creating multiple rules in the conditional formatting dialog.

For example, the following formula applies hex color values to a new **Affordability rank** column, based on existing **Affordability** column values:

![Formula Calculation](media/desktop-conditional-table-formatting/conditional-table-formatting_05.png)

To apply the colors, select **Background color** or **Font color** conditional formatting for the **Affordability** column, and base the formatting on the **Field value** of the **Affordability rank** column.

![Dialog of Format style for background color of Affordability column: Format style drop down is set to Field value.](media/desktop-conditional-table-formatting/conditional-table-formatting_06.png)

The example table with **Affordability** background color based on calculated **Affordability rank** looks like this:

![Example table with a calculated value-based color applied.](media/desktop-conditional-table-formatting/conditional-table-formatting_07.png)

You can create many more variations, just by using your imagination and some calculations.

## Add data bars

To show data bars based on cell values, select **Conditional formatting** for the **Affordability** field, and then select **Data bars** from the drop-down menu. 

In the **Data bars** dialog, the **Show bar only** option is unchecked by default, so the table cells show both the bars and the actual values. To show the data bars only, select the **Show bar only** check box.

You can specify **Minimum** and **Maximum** values, data bar colors and direction, and axis color.

![Data bars dialog with optional checkbox to Show bar only](media/desktop-conditional-table-formatting/table-formatting-3-default.png)

With data bars applied to the **Affordability** column, the example table looks like this:

![Example table with data bars applied](media/desktop-conditional-table-formatting/table-formatting-3-default-table-bars.png)

## Add icons

To show icons based on cell values, select **Conditional formatting** for the field, and then select **Icons** from the drop-down menu. 

In the **Icons** dialog, under **Format style**, select either **Rules** or **Field value**.

To format by rules, select a **What field should we base this on?**, **Summarization** method, **Icon layout**, **Icon alignment**, icon **Style**, and one or more **Rules**. Under **Rules**, enter one or more rules with an *If value* condition and an *and* value condition, and select an icon to apply to each rule.

To format by field values, select a **What field should we base this on?**, **Summarization** method, **Icon layout**, and **Icon alignment**.

The following example adds icons based on three rules:

![Dialog of icons: format style is set to Rules. Available icons are shown under the Style dropdown.](media/desktop-conditional-table-formatting/table-formatting-1-default-table.png)

Select **OK**. With icons applied to the **Affordability** column by rules, the example table looks like this:

![Example table with icons applied](media/desktop-conditional-table-formatting/table-formatting-1-default-dialog.png)

## Format as web URLs

If you have a column or measure that contains website URLs, you can use conditional formatting to apply those URLs to fields as active links. For example, the following table has a **Website** column with website URLs for each state:

![Table with web URL column](media/desktop-conditional-table-formatting/table-formatting-1-diverging.png)

To display each state name as a live link to its website, select **Conditional formatting** for the **State** field, and then select **Web URL**. In the **Web URL** dialog box, under **What field should we based this on?**, select **Website**, and then select **OK**.

With **Web URL** formatting applied to the **State** field, each state name is an active link to its website. The following example table has **Web URL** formatting applied to the **State** column, and conditional **Data bars** applied to the **Overall rank** column.

![Table with web URL and data bars for Overall rank column.](media/desktop-conditional-table-formatting/table-formatting-3-default-table.png)

See [Add hyperlinks (URLs) to a table or matrix](power-bi-hyperlinks-in-tables.md) for more on formatting URLs in a table.

## Totals and subtotals

You can apply conditional formatting rules to totals and subtotals, for both table and matrix visuals.

You apply the conditional formatting rules by using the **Apply to** drop-down in conditional formatting, as shown in the following image.

![Conditional formatting dialog: Apply to dropdown is set to Values and totals.](media/desktop-conditional-table-formatting/table-formatting-4.png)

You must manually set the thresholds and ranges for conditional formatting rules. For matrices, **Values** will refer to the lowest visible level of the matrix hierarchy.

## Color-code based on text

Unlike in Excel, you can't color-code text values to display as a particular color, such as "Accepted"=blue, "Declined"=red, "None"=grey. You create measures related to these values and apply formatting based on those instead.

For example, StatusColor = SWITCH('Table'[Status], "Accepted", "blue", "Declined", "red", "None", "grey")

Then in the **Background color** dialog box, you format the **Status** field based on the values in the **StatusColor** field.

![Dialog of background color for Status field: Format style dropdown is set to Field value.](media/desktop-conditional-table-formatting/power-bi-conditional-based-on-field.png)

In the resulting table, the formatting is based on the value in the **StatusColor** field, which in turn is based on the text in the **Status** field.

## Considerations and limitations
 
There are a few considerations to keep in mind when working with conditional table formatting:

- Any table that doesn't have a grouping is displayed as a single row that doesn't support conditional formatting.
- You can't apply gradient formatting with automatic maximum/minimum values, or rule-based formatting with percentage rules, if your data contains *NaN* values. NaN means "Not a number," most commonly caused by a divide by zero error. You can use the [DIVIDE() DAX function](/dax/divide-function-dax) to avoid these errors.
- Conditional formatting needs an aggregation or measure to be applied to the value. That's why you see 'First' or 'Last' in the **Color by value** example. If you're building your report against an Analysis Service multidimensional cube, you won't be able to use an attribute for conditional formatting unless the cube owner builds a measure that provides the value.
- When printing a report including data bars and background color, you must enable *Background graphics* in the print settings of the browser for the data bars and background colors to print properly.
