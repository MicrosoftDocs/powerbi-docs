# Create a report from an Excel file in the Power BI service

[!INCLUDE [applies-no-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-no-desktop-yes-service.md)]

You've read [Reports in Power BI](../consumer/end-user-reports.md) and now you want to create your own. There are different ways to create a report. In this article, we start by creating a basic report in the Power BI service from an Excel file. Once you understand the basics of creating a report, check out the [Next steps](#next-steps) at the end for more advanced report topics.  

## Prerequisites

- [Sign up for the Power BI service](../fundamentals/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi.md). 


## Import the Excel file

This method of creating a report starts with a file and a blank report canvas. If you want to follow along, download the [Retail Analysis sample Excel file](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=529778) and save it to your computer or to OneDrive for Business.

1. In the navigation pane, select **My Workspace**.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/service-report-create-new/power-bi-select-my-workspace.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting My Workspace.":::
2. From the bottom of the nav pane, select **Get data**.
   
   ![Get data](media/service-report-create-new/power-bi-get-data3.png)
3. Select **Files** and navigate to the location where you saved the Retail Analysis sample.
   
    ![select Files](media/service-report-create-new/power-bi-select-files.png)
4. For this exercise, select **Import**.
   
   ![select Import](media/service-report-create-new/power-bi-import.png)
5. Select **Open**.

   Once the Excel file is imported, it's listed as a *dataset* in the workspace list.

1. Select **More options (...)** next to the dataset, and select **Create report**.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/service-report-create-new/power-bi-dataset-create-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting Create report.":::
6. The report editor opens.

## Add a Radial Gauge to the report
Now that our dataset is imported, let's start answering some questions.  Our Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) wants to know how close we are to meeting this year's sales goals. A Gauge is a [good visualization choice](../visuals/power-bi-report-visualizations.md) for displaying this type of information.

1. In the Fields pane, select **Sales** > **This Year Sales** > **Value**.
   
    ![bar chart in report editor](media/service-report-create-new/power-bi-report-step1.png)
2. Convert the visual to a Gauge by selecting the Gauge template ![Gauge icon](media/service-report-create-new/powerbi-gauge-icon.png) from the **Visualizations** pane.
   
    ![Gauge visual in report editor](media/service-report-create-new/power-bi-report-step2.png)
3. Drag **Sales** > **This Year Sales** > **Goal** to the **Target value** well. Looks like we're very close to our goal.

4. Now would be a good time to save your report.

## Add an area chart and slicer to the report
Our CMO has some additional questions for us to answer. They'd like to know how sales this year compare to last year. And, they'd like to see the findings by district.

1. First, let's make some room on our canvas. Select the Gauge and move it into the top-right corner. Then grab and drag one of the corners and make it smaller.
2. Deselect the gauge. In the Fields pane, select **Sales** > **This Year Sales** > **Value** and select **Sales** > **Last Year Sales**.
   
    ![report editor with Gauge and bar chart](media/service-report-create-new/power-bi-report-step4.png)
3. Convert the visual to an Area chart by selecting the Area chart template ![chart icon](media/service-report-create-new/power-bi-areachart-icon.png) from the **Visualizations** pane.
4. Select **Time** > **Period** to add it to the **Axis** well.
   
    ![report editor with Area chart active](media/service-report-create-new/power-bi-report-step5.png)
5. To sort the visualization by time period, select the ellipses and choose **Sort by Period**.
6. Now let's add the slicer. Select an empty area on the canvas and choose the Slicer ![Slicer icon](media/service-report-create-new/power-bi-slicer-icon.png) template. We now have an empty slicer on our canvas.
   
    ![report canvas](media/service-report-create-new/power-bi-report-step6.png)    
7. From the Fields pane, select **District** > **District**. Move and resize the slicer.
   
    ![Report editor, add District](media/service-report-create-new/power-bi-report-step7.png)  
8. Use the slicer to look for patterns and insights by District.
