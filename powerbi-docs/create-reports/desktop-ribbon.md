## Ribbon features

The ribbon includes the following features:

* **Themes gallery** - The **Themes** gallery on the **View** tab shows previews of color combinations and fonts, similar to PowerPoint themes.
* **Dynamic content** - The ribbon dynamically displays and arranges icons based on context, showing only the options available to you.

* **Keytips** - Press **Alt** to activate keytips, then press the shown keys to navigate and select buttons using the keyboard.
* **Custom format strings** - Select a measure or column to display a **Measure tools** or **Column tools** contextual tab. Type custom format strings directly in the dropdown box.
* **Visuals gallery** - Access visualizations directly from the ribbon to quickly add them to your report.
* **Office themes** - Apply black or dark gray themes to match your preferred appearance.
* **Accessibility** - The title bar, ribbon, and file menu are fully accessible. Press **Ctrl + F6** to navigate to the ribbon section, use **Tab** to move between bars, and use arrow keys to move between elements.
