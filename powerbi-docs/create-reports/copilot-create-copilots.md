# Build your own Copilot solution accelerator for your coworkers

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-yes-desktop-yes-service.md)]

You can create your own Copilots to help your coworkers with their tasks. Copilot helps you use the transformational power of generative AI so your coworkers can get the most from their data.

Copilot is turned on by default in Fabric. Administrators can turn off Copilot in the Fabric admin portal if your organization isn't ready to use it. For details on turning Copilot on and off, see [Enable Fabric Copilot for Power BI](/fabric/get-started/copilot-enable-fabric).

> [!NOTE]
> Copilot isn't yet supported for sovereign clouds due to GPU availability.

## Before you start using Copilot

For optimized results using Copilot for Power BI, you may need to do some clean-up work on your semantic model. Read the article [Update your data model to work well with Copilot](copilot-evaluate-data.md) to see if you need to modify your semantic model so that Copilot can get insights from it.

For answers to common questions related to data security and privacy to help your organization get started with Copilot for Fabric, see the articles in the Fabric documentation:

- [Overview of Copilot for Fabric (preview)](/fabric/get-started/copilot-fabric-overview) 
- [Privacy, security, and responsible use for Copilot for Fabric and Power BI](/fabric/get-started/copilot-power-bi-privacy-security)

## Create your own Copilots

You can create your own Copilots for your organization. See the documentation for [Azure AI Search](/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search) to get started.

## Copilot requirements

See Copilot requirements in the [Overview of Copilot for Power BI](copilot-introduction.md#copilot-requirements) article.

## Copilot preview features

When using the Copilot pane in the **Power BI service**, you'll see a toggle with the word **Preview** next to it. The preview toggle allows you the opportunity to move into an experience that includes both generally available and public preview capabilities. 

To access Copilot features in public preview, select the preview toggle to activate the public preview experience.

If you don't want users in your organization to have access to the preview toggle, you need to [disable Fabric Copilot](/fabric/admin/service-admin-portal-copilot) in your organization or for specific security groups.

See [Use Copilot preview features in Power BI](copilot-preview-toggle.md) for more information about what features are available in preview.

See Copilot requirements in [Overview of Copilot for Power BI](copilot-introduction.md#copilot-requirements).
