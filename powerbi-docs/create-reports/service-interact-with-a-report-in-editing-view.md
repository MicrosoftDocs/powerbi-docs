# Interact with a report in Editing view in the Power BI service

[!INCLUDE [applies-to](../includes/applies-to.md)] [!INCLUDE [yes-service](../includes/yes-service.md)] [!INCLUDE [no-desktop](../includes/no-desktop.md)]

You can create and edit reports in both the Power BI service and Power BI Desktop. In the Power BI service, you create and edit reports in **Editing view**. In Power BI Desktop, you create and edit reports in [Report view](desktop-report-view.md). This article covers Editing view in the Power BI service.

The Power BI service has two different modes for interacting with reports: [Reading view](../consumer/end-user-reading-view.md) for report *business users* and Editing view for report owners and creators. You need a Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) license to share reports and to edit reports created by others. Without a Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) license, you can still create reports in your My Workspace, but you can't [share them](../collaborate-share/service-share-reports.md).

In report Editing view, you have flexibility in both exploring and designing a report. All the [Reading view](../consumer/end-user-reading-view.md) functionality is available plus much more.

## Prerequisites

Assign workspace roles to users so that they can edit reports. Editing view is only available to the person who created the report or to people who are assigned the member, admin, or contributor role in the workspace where the report is stored. If you share a report, the user's access will be limited to their assigned workspace role. Users who have only the viewer role can't edit reports in the workspace. See [Roles in workspaces](../collaborate-share/service-roles-new-workspaces.md) for details on permissions.

## Functionality only available in Editing view

Take a look at the list of articles under the **Power BI reports** header in the Table of Contents. It's a long list and many of the articles cover functionality *only available if you have editing permissions for a report*. To help you navigate the Table of Contents, Editing view is required for the following actions:

* Creating, editing, renaming, sharing, and deleting reports.
* Adding, renaming, rearranging, and deleting report pages.
* Formatting reports.
* Adding visualizations, text boxes, shapes, and buttons to a report.
* Adding visual-level, page-level, and report-level filters and setting visual interactions.
* Creating refresh schedules.
* Using Q&A functionality to create visuals in reports.
* Showing data used to create the visualization.
* Setting up drillthrough.
* Duplicating a report page.
* [Using report settings](power-bi-report-settings.md) to control your readers' interactions with reports.

## Considerations and troubleshooting

A Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) license is required to edit reports created by others and to share your reports with others. If you don't have a Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) license, you can still create reports, but you can't [share them](../collaborate-share/service-share-reports.md).
