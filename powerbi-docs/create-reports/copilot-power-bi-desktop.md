# Use Copilot in Power BI Desktop

To use Copilot in Power BI Desktop, you need admin, member, or contributor access to at least a single workspace that is assigned to a paid Fabric capacity (F64 or higher) or Power BI Premium capacity (P1 or higher) that has Copilot enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> The Copilot button in Desktop always appears in the ribbon. To be able to use Copilot, you must be signed in and have access to a workspace that is in Premium or Fabric capacity.

When you use Copilot in Power BI Desktop for the first time, you’re asked to pick a Copilot compatible workspace when you select the Copilot button in the ribbon. The workspace you select doesn’t need to be the same as the workspace where you plan to publish your report.
