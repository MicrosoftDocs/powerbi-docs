[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-yes-desktop-yes-service.md)]

Are you new to Power BI and want to try it out, but you don't have any data? Or maybe you'd like to see reports that illustrate some of the capabilities of Power BI. We've got you covered.
Power BI offers different kinds of samples for different purposes. There are built-in samples and apps in the Power BI service, *.pbix* files, Excel datasets, and SQL databases. Here's a collection of different samples:

- The [Sales & Returns sample](#sales--returns-sample-pbix-file) Power BI report (*.pbix* file). You can view it in the Data Stories Gallery, open, and explore it in Power BI Desktop, or upload it to the Power BI service.
- The [Artificial Intelligence sample](sample-artificial-intelligence.md) Power BI report. In the report, explore the Power BI artificial intelligence features such as key influencers, root-cause analysis in a decomposition tree, and anomaly detection. Select **Learn** in the Power BI service navigation pane to download a copy from the **Learning Center**.
- [Eight original built-in samples](#eight-original-samples) in the Power BI service, with dashboards, reports, and semantic models. You install them right in the Power BI service. The built-in samples are also available as Power BI reports (*.pbix*) and Excel workbooks (*.xlsx*).
- [Excel workbook](#download-sample-excel-files) versions of the built-in samples, containing the data model. Explore the data model in the Power Pivot add-in for Excel or use the Excel workbook as a data source for a Power BI report.
- A [Financial data sample workbook](sample-financial-download.md), a simple flat table in an Excel file available for download. It contains anonymized data with fictitious products, with sales divided by segments and countries/regions. It makes a useful basic data source for a Power BI report.
- An Excel workbook version of the [AdventureWorks dimensional model](desktop-dimensional-model-report.md), in a tutorial to walk you through creating a Power BI report with the data.
- If you'd rather work with data in SQL databases, the [SQL samples](/sql/samples/sql-samples-where-are) article features links to downloadable AdventureWorks and WorldWideImporters SQL databases in a GitHub repository. The article also has links to other Azure samples.

Our online documentation uses these same samples in tutorials and examples, so you can follow along.

## Sales & Returns sample .pbix file

The following image shows the Sales & Returns sample report.

:::image type="content" source="media/sample-datasets/sales-returns-sample-pbix.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows a Sales & Returns sample *.pbix* file." lightbox="media/sample-datasets/sales-returns-sample-pbix.png" border="true":::

Power BI report designers Miguel Myers and Chris Hamill created the Sales & Returns *.pbix* file to demonstrate many new features in Power BI, including buttons, drillthrough, conditional formatting, what-if, and customized tooltips.

The scenario for this report is a company that sells Microsoft-themed skateboards. They want to see the state of their sales and returns, and analyze how they should modify their operations.

You can explore it these ways:

- Download the *.pbix* file and explore it in depth. Look "behind the curtain" to see how Miguel made it. This link opens the [GitHub repo for Power BI Desktop samples](https://github.com/microsoft/powerbi-desktop-samples/blob/main/Sample%20Reports/Sales%20%26%20Returns%20Sample%20v201912.pbix). Select **Download** to download the Sales & Returns sample *.pbix* file to your computer.
- Read about the report in the Power BI blog post, [Take a tour of the new Sales & Returns sample report](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/take_a_tour_of_the_new_sales_returns_sample_report/).

## Updated samples

There are revised versions of some of the original samples. These new versions take the original semantic models and incorporate the latest visualizations.

The company obviEnce ([www.obvience.com](http://www.obvience.com/)) and Microsoft teamed up to create samples for you to use with Power BI. The samples use anonymized data. The samples represent different industries: finance, HR, sales, and more.

:::image type="content" source="media/sample-datasets/power-bi-samples.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows some available samples in the Learning center page." lightbox="media/sample-datasets/power-bi-samples.png" border="true":::

These samples are available in several formats: as a built-in sample, as an Excel workbook, and as a Power BI *.pbix* file. If you don't know what these things are, or how to get your hands on them, don't worry. This article explains it all.

For each of these samples, we've created a *tour*. Tours are articles that tell the story behind the sample and walk you through different scenarios. One scenario might be answering questions for your manager, another might be looking for competitive insights, or creating reports and dashboards to share, or explaining a business shift.

Before we get started, here are the legal guidelines for using these samples. After that, we introduce the samples and show how to use them.

1. In Power BI Desktop, select **File** > **Open**, navigate to the location where you saved the sample *.pbix* file, and select the *.pbix* file to open it in Power BI Desktop.

## Download sample Excel files

Each of the built-in samples is also available as an Excel workbook. The Excel workbooks are designed to be used as a data source in the Power BI service or Power BI Desktop. If you're an advanced Excel user, you can explore or edit the data models in the Power Pivot add-in to Excel.

1. Download one or all of the [sample Excel files](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=535020) from this GitHub repository.

   - Customer Profitability Sample
   - Human Resources Sample
   - IT Spend Analysis Sample
   - Opportunity Tracking Sample
   - Procurement Analysis Sample
   - Retail Analysis Sample
   - Sales and Marketing Sample
   - Supplier Quality Analysis Sample

1. Save the downloaded file. Where you save the file makes a difference.

   - :::image type="icon" source="media/sample-datasets/power-bi-local-file2.png"::: **Local**: If you save your file to a local drive on your computer, you can publish the files to Power BI from Excel. After you've published it, there's no remaining relationship between your local file and the file in the Power BI service.
   - :::image type="icon" source="media/sample-datasets/power-bi-onedrive-file.png"::: **OneDrive - Business**: If you have OneDrive for work or school and you sign in with the same account as Power BI, you can easily keep your work in your Excel file in sync with Power BI. Power BI and OneDrive are both in the cloud. Power BI connects to your file on OneDrive about every hour. If Power BI detects any changes to the files in OneDrive, it automatically updates your semantic models, reports, and dashboards in the Power BI service.
   - :::image type="icon" source="media/sample-datasets/save-sharepoint-logo.png"::: **SharePoint team sites**: Saving your Power BI files to SharePoint team sites is much the same as saving to OneDrive for work or school. The biggest difference is how you connect to the file from Power BI. You can specify a URL or connect to the root folder.

1. You can use the files as [data sources in Power BI Desktop](../connect-data/service-excel-workbook-files.md), or **Publish to Power BI** from Excel to the Power BI service. When you publish, choose one of these options:

    - **Upload your workbook to Power BI**: Brings the whole Excel file into Power BI.
    - **Export workbook data to Power BI**: Creates a blank Power BI report with all your Excel data in the Fields list.

### Explore Excel samples in Excel

Want to understand how the data in these Excel workbooks gets converted to Power BI semantic models and reports? Opening the Excel samples *in Excel* and exploring the worksheets provides some of the answers.

- When you first open a sample workbook in Excel, you might see two warnings. The first warning says the workbook is in Protected View. Select **Enable Editing**. The second warning might say that the workbook has external data connections. Select **Enable Content**.
- There's only one Excel sheet, the Info sheet. It provides information about obviEnce, the company that created the sample, and explains how to see the data in Power Pivot.
- Where's the actual data? It's in the Power Pivot data model. On the **PowerPivot** tab, select **Manage**. In Power Pivot, you can see the data in all the underlying tables, plus all the DAX formulas.

   > [!TIP]
   > Don't see the **Power Pivot** tab? [Enable the Power Pivot add-in](https://support.office.com/article/Start-Power-Pivot-in-Microsoft-Excel-2013-add-in-A891A66D-36E3-43FC-81E8-FC4798F39EA8).

### Upload the Excel files to the Power BI service

1. Open the Power BI service (`app.powerbi.com`) and sign in.

1. Navigate to your **My workspace** or to another workspace, or create a workspace just for the sample.

1. In the upper-left corner of the workspace, select **Upload**, then select one of the sources.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-datasets/power-bi-upload.png" alt-text="This screenshot shows the Power BI Upload.":::

1. Select the file. Depending on where the file is, select **Upload** or **Open**.

The Power BI service uploads your Excel file.
