[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-yes-desktop-yes-service.md)]

Are you new to Power BI and need data to get started? This article introduces built-in samples, reports, and datasets to help you explore Power BI's capabilities.

Power BI provides samples for different purposes, such as built-in samples, apps in the Power BI service, *.pbix* files, Excel datasets, and SQL databases. Here's a list of available samples:

- The [Sales & Returns sample](#sales--returns-sample-pbix-file) Power BI report (*.pbix* file). You can view it in the Data Stories Gallery, open it in Power BI Desktop, or upload it to the Power BI service.
- The [Artificial Intelligence sample](sample-artificial-intelligence.md) Power BI report. Explore Power BI artificial intelligence features like key influencers, root cause analysis in a decomposition tree, and anomaly detection. In the Power BI service navigation pane, select **Learn** to download a copy from the **Learning Center**.
- [Eight original built-in samples](#eight-original-samples) in the Power BI service, including dashboards, reports, and semantic models. You can install them directly in the Power BI service. The built-in samples are also available as Power BI reports (*.pbix*) and Excel workbooks (*.xlsx*).
- [Excel workbook](#download-sample-excel-files) versions of the built-in samples, containing the data model. Explore the data model in the Power Pivot add-in for Excel or use the Excel workbook as a data source for a Power BI report.
- A [Financial data sample workbook](sample-financial-download.md), a simple flat table in an Excel file available for download. It contains anonymized data with fictitious products, with sales divided by segments and countries/regions. Use this workbook as a data source for a Power BI report.
- An Excel workbook version of the [AdventureWorks dimensional model](desktop-dimensional-model-report.md), in a tutorial to walk you through creating a Power BI report with the data.
- If you prefer working with data in SQL databases, go to the [SQL samples](/sql/samples/sql-samples-where-are) article for links to downloadable AdventureWorks and Worldwide Importers SQL databases in a GitHub repository. The article also links to other Azure samples.

The online documentation uses these same samples in tutorials and examples, so you can follow along.

## Sales and returns sample .pbix file

This image shows the Sales and Returns sample report.

:::image type="content" source="media/sample-datasets/sales-returns-sample-pbix.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales and Returns sample *.pbix* file." lightbox="media/sample-datasets/sales-returns-sample-pbix.png" border="true":::

The Sales and Returns *.pbix* file demonstrates new Power BI features like buttons, drillthrough, conditional formatting, what-if analysis, and customized tooltips.

This report is based on a company that sells Microsoft-themed skateboards. The company wants to see the state of its sales and returns and analyze how to modify its operations.

Explore the report in these ways:

- Download the *.pbix* file to explore it in depth and see how it was created. Use this [GitHub repo for Power BI Desktop samples](https://github.com/microsoft/powerbi-desktop-samples/blob/main/Sample%20Reports/Sales%20%26%20Returns%20Sample%20v201912.pbix). Select **Download** to save the Sales and Returns sample *.pbix* file to your computer.

## Install built-in samples

Start with the *built-in samples*. These samples are available in the Power BI service, so you don't need to leave Power BI to find them. Each sample includes dashboards, semantic models, and reports that work with the Power BI service. Built-in samples aren't available in Power BI Desktop.

1. Open the Power BI service (`app.powerbi.com`) and sign in.
1. Select **Learn** in the left navigation pane.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-datasets/get-data-samples.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Learning center showing where to get samples." lightbox="media/sample-datasets/get-data-samples.png" border="true":::

1. On the **Learning center** page, under **Sample reports**, scroll to locate a sample.
  
   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-datasets/power-bi-connect.png" alt-text="Screenshot highlighting a sample report.":::

1. Select the sample. It opens in Reading mode.
1. Power BI imports the built-in sample, adding a new report and semantic model to **My workspace**. Some samples include a dashboard. Use these samples to explore the Power BI service.

## Download sample Excel files

Each built-in sample is available as an Excel workbook. These workbooks are designed for use as a data source in the Power BI service or Power BI Desktop. If you're an advanced Excel user, explore or edit the data models with the Power Pivot add-in for Excel.

1. Download one or more [sample Excel files](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=535020) from the GitHub repository.
1. Save the downloaded file. The file's location is important.

   - :::image type="icon" source="media/sample-datasets/power-bi-local-file2.png"::: **Local**: Save the file to a local drive on your computer to publish it to Power BI from Excel. After publishing, the local file and the file in the Power BI service aren't connected.
   - :::image type="icon" source="media/sample-datasets/power-bi-onedrive-file.png"::: **OneDrive - Business**: Save your file to OneDrive for work or school and sign in with the same account as Power BI to keep your Excel file in sync. Power BI connects to your OneDrive file hourly and updates semantic models, reports, and dashboards in the Power BI service automatically when changes are detected.
   - :::image type="icon" source="media/sample-datasets/save-sharepoint-logo.png"::: **SharePoint team sites**: Save your Power BI files to SharePoint team sites, similar to OneDrive for work or school. The main difference is how you connect to the file from Power BI—specify a URL or connect to the root folder.

1. Use the files as [data sources in Power BI Desktop](../connect-data/service-excel-workbook-files.md), or **Publish to Power BI** from Excel to the Power BI service. When publishing, choose one of these options:

    - **Upload your workbook to Power BI**: Uploads the whole Excel file into Power BI.
    - **Export workbook data to Power BI**: Creates a blank Power BI report that includes all your Excel data in the Fields list.

### Explore Excel samples

Want to understand how the data in these Excel workbooks converts to Power BI semantic models and reports? Open the Excel samples in *Excel* and explore the worksheets for details.

- When you first open a sample workbook in Excel, you might see two warnings. The first warning says the workbook is in Protected View. Select **Enable Editing**. The second warning might say that the workbook has external data connections. Select **Enable Content**.
- There's only one Excel sheet, the Info sheet. It provides information about obviEnce, the company that created the sample, and explains how to see the data in Power Pivot.
- Where's the actual data? It's in the Power Pivot data model. On the **PowerPivot** tab, select **Manage**. In Power Pivot, you can see the data in all the underlying tables, plus all the DAX formulas.

   > [!TIP]
   > Don't see the **Power Pivot** tab? [Enable the Power Pivot add-in](https://support.office.com/article/Start-Power-Pivot-in-Microsoft-Excel-2013-add-in-A891A66D-36E3-43FC-81E8-FC4798F39EA8).

### Upload the Excel files to the Power BI service

1. Go to the Power BI service (`app.powerbi.com`) and sign in.
1. Go to **My workspace**, another workspace, or create a workspace specifically for the sample.
1. In the upper-left corner of the workspace, select **Upload**, and then select one of the sources.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-datasets/power-bi-upload.png" alt-text="This screenshot shows the Power BI Upload.":::

1. Select the file. Depending on where the file is, select **Upload** or **Open**.

The Power BI service uploads your Excel file.
