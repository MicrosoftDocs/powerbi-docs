# What are Power BI samples

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-yes-desktop-yes-service.md)]

Ready to explore Power BI hands-on? This page brings together ready-made samples, reports, and datasets you can open, inspect, and reuse to learn Power BI fast. Get access to built-in samples and apps, downloadable .pbix and .pbit files, Excel workbooks, and SQL sample databases — all with direct download links and links to articles that explain the data model, visuals, and techniques used. 

## Sample file overview

Use these samples to try features, prototype reports, validate scenarios, or jumpstart your own projects. Follow the instructions to open them in Power BI Desktop or upload them to the Power BI service.

The samples in this article are available in multiple formats, but two common ways to get started are with *.pbix* and *.xlsx* files:

- *.pbix*: A Power BI Desktop report file that contains the report pages, data model, queries, and visuals. Download a *.pbix* when you want to open a complete report directly in Power BI Desktop and explore or modify both the visual layer and the underlying model.
- *.xlsx*: An Excel workbook that contains the sample data (and sometimes a Power Pivot model). Use the *.xlsx* files as data sources in Power BI Desktop or publish them from Excel to the Power BI service; advanced Excel users can open the workbook in Power Pivot to inspect or edit the data model.

These two formats are highlighted here for clarity, but they’re only two of the formats available for Power BI samples (others include templates, direct database samples, and packaged content).

### Use a sample .pbix file

Some samples are available as Power BI *.pbix* files. The *.pbix* files are designed to be used with Power BI Desktop.

1. Select a **.pbix** link from the table to download the sample file.
1. In Power BI Desktop, select **File** > **Open**, navigate to the location where you saved the sample *.pbix* file, and select the *.pbix* file to open it in Power BI Desktop.

### Use a sample .xlsx file

Each of the built-in samples is also available as an Excel workbook. The Excel workbooks are designed to be used as a data source in the Power BI service or Power BI Desktop. If you're an advanced Excel user, you can explore or edit the data models in the Power Pivot add-in to Excel.

1. Select an **.xlsx** link from the table to download the sample file.
1. You can use the files as data sources in Power BI Desktop, or Publish to Power BI from Excel to the Power BI service.
1. In the Power BI service (`app.powerbi.com`), navigate to **My workspace** or to another workspace of your choice.
1. In the upper-left corner of the workspace, select **Upload**, then select one of the sources.
1. Select the .xlsx sample file. Depending on where the file is, select **Upload** or **Open**.
