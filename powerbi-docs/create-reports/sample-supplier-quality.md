# Supplier Quality Analysis sample for Power BI: Take a tour

This industry sample dashboard and underlying report focus on one of the typical supply chain challenges: supplier quality analysis. Two primary metrics are at play in this analysis: total number of defects and the total downtime that these defects caused. 

This sample has two main objectives:

* Understand who the best and worst suppliers are, with respect to quality.
* Identify which plants do a better job finding and rejecting defects, to minimize downtime.

This sample is part of a series that shows how you can use Power BI with business-oriented data, reports, and dashboards. The company [obviEnce](http://www.obvience.com) created this sample using real, anonymized data. The data is available in several formats: built-in sample in the Power BI service, *.pbix* Power BI Desktop file, or Excel workbook. See [Samples for Power BI](sample-datasets.md).

This tutorial explores the Supplier Quality Analysis built-in sample in the Power BI service. Because the report experience is similar in Power BI Desktop and in the service, you can also follow along by using the sample *.pbix* file in Power BI Desktop. Get the sample in one of the following ways:

* Get the [built-in sample in the Power BI service](#get-the-built-in-sample).
* Download the [.pbix file](#get-the-pbix-file-for-this-sample).
* Download the [Excel workbook](#get-the-excel-workbook-for-this-sample).

## Prerequisites

You don't need a Power BI license to explore the sample in Power BI Desktop. You just need a [Fabric free license](../consumer/end-user-features.md) to explore the sample in the Power BI service, and save it to your **My workspace**.

## Get the built-in sample

1. Open the Power BI service (`app.powerbi.com`), and select **Learn** in the left navigation.

1. On the **Learning center** page, under **Sample reports**, scroll until you see the **Supplier Quality Analysis Sample**.

1. Select the sample. It opens in Reading mode.

1. Power BI imports the built-in sample, adding a new dashboard, report, and semantic model to your current workspace.

    :::image type="content" source="media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier-quality-entry.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Opportunity Analysis sample entries in the workspace.":::

    Select the dashboard to view the sample dashboard.

## Get the .pbix file for this sample

Alternatively, you can download the Supplier Quality Analysis sample as a [.pbix file](https://download.microsoft.com/download/8/C/6/8C661638-C102-4C04-992E-9EA56A5D319B/Supplier-Quality-Analysis-Sample-PBIX.pbix), which is designed for use with Power BI Desktop.

1. After you open the file in Power BI Desktop, select **File** > **Publish** > **Publish to Power BI** or choose **Publish** in the **Home** ribbon.

1. In the **Publish to Power BI** dialog, choose a workspace and then **Select**.

1. In the Power BI service, in your workspace, scroll down to the **Supplier Quality Analysis Sample** report and select to open.

1. From the **More options** (...) menu, select **Pin to a dashboard**. Select **New dashboard**, enter a name, and choose **Pin live**.

The dashboard that you create this way isn't the same as the sample dashboard created by the built-in sample. You can still use Q&A and make changes to your dashboard.

## Get the Excel workbook for this sample

If you want to view the data source for this sample, it's also available as an Excel workbook. To see the raw data, enable the Data Analysis add-ins, and then select **Power Pivot > Manage**. 

If you want to get and use the Excel file in the Power BI service, follow these steps:

1. Download the sample from [Power BI Desktop samples](https://github.com/microsoft/powerbi-desktop-samples/tree/main/powerbi-service-samples). The file is called *Supplier Quality Analysis Sample-no-PV.xlsx*.

1. Open the file in Excel and then select **File** > **Publish** > **Publish to Power BI**.

1. Select a workspace, such as **My workspace**, and choose **Export**.

   There are different ways to work with Excel files. For more information, see [Explore the Excel samples in Excel](sample-datasets.md#explore-excel-samples-in-excel).

1. In the Power BI service, the exported data appears as a semantic model in the selected workspace. Select **More options** (...) > **Auto-create report**.

1. Select **Save**, enter a name for your report, and then choose **Save**.

1. From the **More options** (...) menu, select **Pin to a dashboard**. Select **New dashboard**, enter a name, and choose **Pin live**.

The dashboard that you create this way isn't the same as the sample dashboard created by the built-in sample. You can still use Q&A and make changes to your dashboard.

## Downtime caused by defective materials

With the [built-in sample in the Power BI service](#get-the-built-in-sample), you have a report and a dashboard. Let's start the tour at the dashboard to analyze the downtime caused by defective materials and see which vendors are responsible.  

1. On the dashboard, select the **Total Defect Quantity** or the **Total Downtime Minutes** tile.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the tiles to open the Downtime Analysis page.":::

   The Supplier Quality Analysis Sample report opens to the **Downtime Analysis** page.

   Notice we have 33 million defective pieces, causing a total downtime of 77,000 minutes. Although some materials have fewer defective pieces, they can cause delays, which result in more downtime. Let's explore them on the report page.  

2. If we look at the **Total Downtime Minutes** line in the **Defects and Downtime (min) by Material Type** combo chart, we can see that corrugate materials cause the most downtime.

3. Select the **Corrugate** column to see which plants are affected most by this defect and which vendor is responsible.  

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Corrugate column selected." lightbox="media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier-3-lightbox.png":::

4. In the **Downtime (min) by Plant** map, select individual plants in turn to see which vendor or material is responsible for the downtime at that plant.

### Which are the worst suppliers?

 We want to find the worst eight suppliers and determine what percentage of the downtime they're responsible for creating. We can do so by changing the **Downtime (min) by Vendor** area chart to a treemap.  

1. On the **Downtime Analysis** page of the report, select **Edit** in the top menu.  

2. Select the **Downtime (min) by Vendor** area chart, and in the **Visualizations** pane, select the **Treemap** icon.  

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier-4.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Treemap icon selected.":::

   The treemap automatically sets the **Vendor** field as the **Group**.  

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier-5.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Downtime (min) by Vendor treemap." lightbox="media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier-5-lightbox.png":::

   From this treemap, we can see the top eight vendors are the eight blocks on the left of the treemap. We can also see they account for about 50% of all downtime minutes.  

3. Select **Supplier Quality** from the left navigation bar to return to the dashboard.

### Comparing plants

Now let's explore which plant does a better job managing defective material, resulting in less downtime.  

1. On the dashboard, select the **Total Defect Reports by Plant, Defect Type** map tile.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier-6.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the tile for Total Defect Reports by Plant, Defect Type." lightbox="media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier-6-lightbox.png":::

   The report opens to the **Supplier Quality Analysis** page.  

2. In the legend of the **Total Defect Reports by Plant and Defect Type**, select **Impact**.  

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier-7.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Total Defect Reports by Plant and Defect Type with the Impact circle selected in the legend." lightbox="media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier-7.png":::

   Notice in the bubble chart that **Logistics** is the most troublesome category. It's the largest in terms of total defect quantity, defect reports, and downtime minutes. Let's explore this category more.  

3. Select the **Logistics** bubble in the bubble chart and observe the plants in Springfield and Naperville, IL. Naperville seems to be doing a much better job of managing defective supplies as it has a high number of rejects and few impacts, compared to Springfield's large number for impacts.  

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier-8.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the results of selecting the Logistics bubble." lightbox="media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier-8-lightbox.png":::

4. Select **Supplier Quality** in the left navigation bar to return to the dashboard.

## Which material type is best managed?

The best managed material type is the one with lowest downtime or no impact, regardless of defect quantity.

1. In the dashboard, look at the **Total Defect Quantity by Material Type, Defect Type** tile.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier-9.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the tile for Total Defect Quantity by Material Type, Defect Type.":::

   Notice that although **Raw Materials** material type has many total defects, most of those defects are either rejected or have no impact.

   Let's verify that this material type doesn't cause much downtime, despite high defect quantity.

2. In the dashboard, look at the **Total Defect Qty, Total Downtime Minutes by Material Type** tile.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier-10.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the tile for Total Defect Qty, Total Downtime Minutes by Material Type.":::

   Raw materials appear to be well managed; although they have more defects, they have lower total downtime minutes.

### Compare defects to downtime by year

1. Select the **Total Defect Reports by Plant, Defect Type** map tile to open the report to the **Supplier Quality Analysis** page.
2. In the **Total Defect Qty by Month and Year** chart, notice that defect quantity is higher in 2014 than in 2013.  

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier-11.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Total Defect Qty by Month and Year chart." lightbox="media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier-11-lightbox.png":::

3. Do more defects translate into more downtime? Ask questions in the Q&A box to find out.  
4. Select **Supplier Quality** in the left navigation bar to return to the dashboard.  
5. Because we know that raw materials have the highest number of defects, type the following query into the question box: *show material types, year, and total defect qty*.  

   There were many more raw materials defects in 2014 than in 2013.  

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier-12.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the question box: Show material types, year, and total defect qty." lightbox="media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier-12.png":::

6. Next, change the question to: *show material types, year, and total downtime minutes*.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier-13.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the question box: Show material types, year, and total downtime minutes." lightbox="media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier-13.png":::

   Notice that downtime for raw materials was about the same in 2013 and 2014, even though there were many more raw materials defects in 2014. It appears that more defects for raw materials in 2014 didn't lead to much more downtime for raw materials in 2014.

### Compare defects to downtime month to month

Let's look at another dashboard tile related to total defective quantity.  

1. Select **Exit Q&A** in the upper-left corner to return to the dashboard.  

   Look more closely at the **Total Defect Quantity by Month, Year** tile. It shows that the first half of 2014 had a similar number of defects as 2013, but in the second half of 2014, the number of defects increased significantly.  

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier-14.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the tile for Total Defect Quantity by Month, Year.":::

    Let's see if this increase in defect quantity led to an equal increase in downtime minutes.  

2. In the question box, type *total downtime minutes by month and year as a line chart*.  

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier-15.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the question box: Total downtime minutes by month and year as a line chart." lightbox="media/sample-supplier-quality/supplier-15.png":::

   Other than a jump in downtime minutes during June and October, the number of defects didn't result in significantly more downtime. This result shows we're managing defects well.  

3. To pin this chart to your dashboard, select the pin icon :::image type="icon" source="media/sample-supplier-quality/pin.png"::: above the question box.

4. To explore the outlier months, check out the downtime minutes during October by material type, plant location, category, and so on, by asking questions such as *total downtime minutes in October by plant*.

5. Select **Exit Q&A** in the upper-left corner to return to the dashboard.
