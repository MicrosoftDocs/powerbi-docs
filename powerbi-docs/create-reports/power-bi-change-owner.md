# Change the owner of a report

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-yes-desktop-yes-service.md)]

As a best practice, reports should have more than one owner, in case of anything happens to a report owner. You always want a report to have an active owner who is still with your company.

## Prerequisites

The report needs to live in a workspace that can have more than one member. It can't be in your personal workspace.

## Add owners to the workspace

1. Create a workspace.
1. Add other people to the workspace.
1. Make at least one of those people an owner of the workspace.

Now that person can delete you from the workspace, and the report still has an owner.
