# Interact with filters in Copilot for Power BI 

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-yes-desktop-yes-service.md)]

You can use Copilot in Power BI to set, clear, and delete filters. With a Power BI report populated with visuals, you can now interact with your filters and slicers using Power BI Copilot. New users often find it unfamiliar to interact with filters on the filter pane or slicers. At the same time, they find it useful to ask Copilot for help with managing the existing filters in the report. You can now apply, remove, append, and clear filters by creating a prompt in the Copilot chat pane.

## Remove a filter  

You can ask also Power BI Copilot to remove filters that are already applied.

If you have filters that are already applied on the report and you want to add other filters on top of that you can do it, by appending the extra filter and referring that to the Copilot.
