# Follow your goals

[!INCLUDE [applies-no-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-no-desktop-yes-service.md)]

Use the _Follow_ functionality to quickly access goals you’re interested in and stay up to date on the activity on these goals. You can follow goals as you’re browsing through different scorecards and later access all your followed goals in one place. So, you can get a quick overview of the goals you care about, without having to navigate to different scorecards often.

To follow, hover over the goal in the scorecard to select the **Follow metric** icon.

To see all your followed goals, go to the Metrics hub and select **Following**.

Once you follow a goal, you get Teams notifications whenever the goal definition is updated. Examples of an update are when a check-in is added or an automated status rule changes the status of the goal. Read more about [notifications in Teams](../collaborate-share/service-teams-notifications.md).

To unfollow and stop getting Teams notifications, hover over the goals and select the **Unfollow goal**.
