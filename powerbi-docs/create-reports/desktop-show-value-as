# Show value as in Power BI

The Show value as feature in Power BI lets you display your data as percentages of totals, such as percent of grand total, row total or column total, instead of just raw values. This can help provide context for values in visuals and is particularly useful when creating executive dashboards, performance reports, or comparative views.

This feature is available in the context menu for numerical values or fields placed in the Values of matrix, table or chart visualizations.

## Example of Matrix Visualizaiton

Let’s use the AdventureWorks DW 2020 dataset and build a Matrix with Country-Region from the Customer table in Rows, and Sales Amount from the Sales table to Values. Then, we’ll apply various "Show value as" options to compare results.
