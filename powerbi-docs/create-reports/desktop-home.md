# Use Home in Power BI Desktop

Power BI Home is a central location for your Power BI content, and is designed to consolidate your Power BI tasks into a single location, eliminating the need to navigate through multiple menus.

The following sections describe the areas and functionality of Power BI Home.

## Open a new report

You can open a new report by expanding the **New** section in Power BI Desktop Home, and selecting **Report**.

Selecting **Report** button creates a new report, and opens a blank canvas on which you can add data and begin building your report.

## Open a recommended report

You can open existing reports from the **Recommended** section of Power BI Home. Files are recommended if they've been recently viewed, edited, edited by someone else, or shared with you.

You can collapse the **New** and **Recommended** sections by selecting the small arrow next to their titles.

## Quick access list

In Power BI Home, a list of reports you've recently accessed is displayed below the **Recent** section. Each item shows the file name, its location, and the last time you opened the file.

When you select the **Shared with Me** button at the top of the quick access list, the quick access list displays files that are shared by people in the same organization. Providing a central location for shared files makes it easier to work together in Power BI.
