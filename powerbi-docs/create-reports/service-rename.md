## Rename a workspace

Anyone with Admin permissions can rename a workspace.

1. Start in the list of workspaces.
2. Next to the workspace you'd like to rename, select **More options** (...), and select **Workspace settings**. If you don't see this option, then you don't have permissions to rename the workspace.

## Rename a page in a report

Don't like the name of a page in your Power BI report? A new name is just a click away. Pages can be renamed in [report Editing view](service-interact-with-a-report-in-editing-view.md).

1. Open the report in [Editing View](../consumer/end-user-reading-view.md).
2. Locate the report page tabs at the bottom of the Power BI window.

3. Open the report page that you'd like to rename by selecting the tab.
4. Double-click the name on the tab to highlight it.

5. Type a new report page name and select ENTER.

## Considerations and troubleshooting

* If the item to be renamed has been shared with you, or is part of an app, you won't see the gear icon and you won't have access to Settings.
* On the **Semantic models** tab, if you don't see **More options** (...), expand your browser window.
