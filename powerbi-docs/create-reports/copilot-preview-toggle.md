# Use Copilot preview features in Power BI

[!INCLUDE [applies-no-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-no-desktop-yes-service.md)]

Copilot for Microsoft Fabric is generally available starting with features in Power BI. This article provides an overview of the capabilities in public preview for the Power BI Copilot chat pane.

## Before you start

Read about all the ways Copilot can help you in the [overview of Copilot for Power BI](copilot-introduction.md) for more guidance before you start.

[!INCLUDE [copilot-notes](../includes/copilot-notes.md)]

## What's available in the Copilot public preview experience?

When you use the preview toggle to switch into the Copilot public preview experience, you have access to all generally available features along with additional public preview features.

**You can use the following public preview features in the preview experience:**
- [Ask Copilot for data from your semantic model](copilot-ask-data-question.md)
- [Enhanced report creation in Power BI service with Copilot](copilot-create-report-service.md)

You can also use all generally available features in the preview experience including:
- [Create reports in the Power BI service with Copilot](copilot-create-report-service.md)
- [Write Copilot prompts for creating report pages in Power BI](copilot-prompts-report-pages.md)
- [Summarize a report page in the Copilot pane](copilot-pane-summarize-content.md)

## What is the preview toggle?

When using the Copilot pane in the Power BI service, you'll see a toggle with the word **Preview** next to it. The preview toggle allows you the opportunity to move into an experience that includes both generally available and public preview capabilities. By default, the toggle is off, giving you the generally available Copilot pane experience to start. Moving into the preview experience allows you the opportunity to try the newest Copilot capabilities.

If you don't want users in your organization to have access to the preview toggle, you need to [disable Fabric Copilot](/fabric/admin/service-admin-portal-copilot) in your organization or for specific security groups.

## How to use the preview toggle

To access Copilot features in public preview, select the preview toggle to activate the public preview experience.

When the preview toggle is green, you now have access to the public preview experience. The welcome card notifies you that you're now in the preview version of Copilot. At any point in time, you can select the toggle to turn the preview experience off and return to use only features that are generally available.

## Considerations and limitations

Considerations for using the preview experience:

- By having Fabric Copilot enabled in your organization, users have access to the Copilot preview pane toggle by default. To disable the toggle for users, [disable Fabric Copilot](/fabric/admin/service-admin-portal-copilot) in your organization or for specific security groups.
- Experiences in the preview toggle are still in a **preview** state, and therefore do not meet all the requirements of a generally available Microsoft feature.

Limitations of the preview experience:

- Chat history isn't saved when switching between the GA state and the preview state.
- The preview toggle isn't available in Power BI Desktop. The Copilot chat pane in Power BI Desktop isn't yet generally available making **all Copilot Desktop experiences in a preview state.**
- The state of the preview toggle **persists across sessions and tabs within the same browser**. For example, if you enable the preview experience in Microsoft Edge and then open the Copilot experience in a new report in Microsoft Edge, Copilot remains in the preview state.
- The state of the preview toggle **does not persist across different browser types**. For example, if you enable the preview experience in Microsoft Edge and then open the Copilot experience within Google Chrome, Copilot defaults to the generally available experience.
