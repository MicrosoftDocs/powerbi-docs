# IT Spend Analysis sample for Power BI: Take a tour

> [!NOTE]
> For an updated version of this sample, see [Corporate Spend sample for Power BI: Take a tour](sample-it-spend.md).

The IT Spend Analysis built-in sample contains a dashboard, report, and semantic model that analyzes the planned vs. actual costs of an IT department. This comparison helps you understand how well the company planned for the year and investigate areas with huge deviations from the plan. The company in this example goes through a yearly planning cycle, and then quarterly it produces a new latest estimate (LE) to help analyze changes in IT spend over the fiscal year.

This sample is part of a series that shows how you can use Power BI with business-oriented data, reports, and dashboards. The company [obviEnce](http://www.obvience.com/) created this sample using real, anonymized data. The data is available in several formats: built-in sample in the Power BI service, *.pbix* Power BI Desktop file, or Excel workbook. See [Samples for Power BI](sample-datasets.md).

This tour explores the IT Spend Analysis built-in sample in the Power BI service. Because the report experience is similar in Power BI Desktop and in the Power BI service, you can also follow along by using the sample *.pbix* file in Power BI Desktop.

## Prerequisites

You don't need a Power BI license to explore the samples in Power BI Desktop. You just need a [Fabric free license](../consumer/end-user-features.md) to explore the sample in the Power BI service, and save it to your **My workspace**.

## Get the sample

Before you can use the sample, get the sample in one of the following ways:

- Get the [built-in sample in the service](#get-the-built-in-sample).
- Download the [.pbix file](#get-the-pbix-file-for-this-sample).
- Download the [Excel workbook](#get-the-excel-workbook-for-this-sample).

### Get the built-in sample

1. Open the Power BI service (`app.powerbi.com`), and select **Learn** in the left navigation.

1. On the **Learning center** page, under **Sample reports**, scroll until you see the **IT Spend Analysis Sample**.

1. Select the sample. It opens in Reading mode.

1. Power BI imports the built-in sample, adding a new dashboard, report, and semantic model to your current workspace.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-it-spend/it-spend-analysis-sample-entry.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the IT Spend Analysis sample dashboard link.":::

   Select the dashboard to view the sample dashboard.
  
### Get the .pbix file for this sample

Alternatively, you can download the IT Spend Analysis sample as a [.pbix file](https://download.microsoft.com/download/E/9/8/E98CEB6D-CEBB-41CF-BA2B-1A1D61B27D87/IT%20Spend%20Analysis%20Sample%20PBIX.pbix), which is designed for use with Power BI Desktop.

1. After you open the file in Power BI Desktop, select **File** > **Publish** > **Publish to Power BI** or choose **Publish** in the **Home** ribbon.

1. In the **Publish to Power BI** dialog, choose a workspace and then **Select**.

1. In the Power BI service, in your workspace, scroll down to the **IT Spend Analysis Sample** report and select to open.

1. From the **More options** (...) menu, select **Pin to a dashboard**. Select **New dashboard**, enter a name, and choose **Pin live**.

The dashboard that you create this way isn't the same as the sample dashboard created by the built-in sample. You can still use Q&A and make changes to your dashboard.

### Get the Excel workbook for this sample

If you want to view the data source for this sample, it's also available as an Excel workbook. To see the raw data, enable the Data Analysis add-ins, and then select **Power Pivot** > **Manage**.

If you want to get and use the Excel file in the Power BI service, follow these steps:

1. Download the sample from [Power BI Desktop samples](https://github.com/microsoft/powerbi-desktop-samples/tree/main/powerbi-service-samples). The file is called *IT Spend Analysis Sample-no-PV.xlsx*.

1. Open the file in Excel and then select **File** > **Publish** > **Publish to Power BI**.

1. Select a workspace, such as **My workspace**, and choose **Export**.

   There are different ways to work with Excel files. For more information, see [Explore the Excel samples in Excel](sample-datasets.md#explore-excel-samples-in-excel).

1. In the Power BI service, the exported data appears as a semantic model in the selected workspace. Select **More options** (...) > **Auto-create report**.

1. Select **Save**, enter a name for your report, and then choose **Save**.

1. From the **More options** (...) menu, select **Pin to a dashboard**. Select **New dashboard**, enter a name, and choose **Pin live**.

The dashboard that you create this way isn't the same as the sample dashboard created by the built-in sample. You can still use Q&A and make changes to your dashboard.

## IT Spend Analysis Sample dashboard

If you used the built-in sample, the two numbers tiles on the left of the dashboard, **Var Plan %** and **Variance Latest Estimate % Quarter 3**, give you an overview of how well we're doing against the plan and against the latest quarterly estimate (LE3 = latest estimate quarter 3). Overall, we're about 6% off the plan. Let's explore the cause of this variance: when, where, and in which category.

### YTD IT Spend Trend Analysis page

When you select the **Var Plan % by Sales Region** dashboard tile, it displays the **YTD IT Spend Trend Analysis** page of the IT Spend Analysis Sample report. At a glance, we see that there's positive variance in the United States and Europe and negative variance in Canada, Latin America, and Australia. The United States has about 6% +LE variance and Australia has about 7% -LE variance.

:::image type="content" source="media/sample-it-spend/it2.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Var Plan % by Sales Region.":::

However, just looking at this chart and drawing conclusions can be misleading. We need to look at actual dollar amounts to put things in perspective.

1. Select **Aus and NZ** in the **Var Plan % by Sales Region** chart, and then observe the **Var Plan by IT Area** chart.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-it-spend/it3.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the YTD IT Spend Trend Analysis page.":::

1. Now select **USA**. Notice that Australia and New Zealand are a very small part of our overall spending as compared to the United States.

   Next, explore which category in the USA is causing the variance.

### YTD Spend by Cost Elements page

1. Return to the dashboard and look at the **Variance Plan %, Variance Latest Estimate % - Quarter 3** dashboard tile.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-it-spend/it5.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Var Plan %, Var LE3 tile.":::

   Notice that the **Infrastructure** area stands out with a large positive variance to the plan.

1. Select this tile to open the report and view the **YTD Spend by Cost Elements** page.

1. Select the **Infrastructure** bar in the **Var Plan % and Var LE3 % by IT Area** chart on the lower right, and observe the variance-to-plan values in the **Var Plan % by Sales Region** chart on the lower left.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-it-spend/it6.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the YTD Spend by Cost Elements page.":::

1. Select each name in turn in the **Cost Element Group** slicer to find the cost element with the largest variance.

1. With **Other** selected, select **Infrastructure** in the **IT Area** slicer and select subareas in the **IT Sub Area** slicer to find the subarea with the largest variance.  

   Notice the large variance for **Networking**. Apparently the company decided to give its employees phone services as a benefit, even though this move wasn't planned for.

## Ask questions of the data

1. In the dashboard, select **Ask a question about your data**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-it-spend/it-area-chart.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting Top cost element groups by plan.":::

1. From the **Try one of these to get started** list on the left side, select **top cost element groups by plan**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-it-spend/question-results.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the results of selecting Top cost element groups by plan.":::

1. In the Q&A box, clear the previous entry and enter *show IT areas, var plan % and var le3 % bar chart*.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sample-it-spend/it4.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the result of the entry in the Q&A box described here.":::

   In the first IT area, **Infrastructure**, the percentage has changed drastically between the initial variance plan and the variance plan latest estimate.

## Plan Variance Analysis page

1. Select the **Plan Variance Analysis** page.

1. In the **Var Plan and Var Plan % by Business Area** chart on the left, select the **Infrastructure** column to highlight infrastructure business area values in the rest of the page.

    :::image type="content" source="media/sample-it-spend/it7.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Plan Variance Analysis page.":::

   Notice in the **Var plan % by Month and Business Area** chart that the infrastructure business area started a positive variance in February. Also, notice how the variance-to-plan value for that business area varies by country or region, as compared to all other business areas.

1. Use the **IT Area** and **IT Sub Area** slicers on the right to filter the values in the rest of the page and to explore the data.

## Edit the report

Select **Edit** in the black **Power BI** header bar to explore in the editing view:

- See how the pages are made, the fields in each chart, and the filters on the pages.
- Add pages and charts, based on the same data.
- Change the visualization type for each chart.
- Pin charts of interest to your dashboard.
