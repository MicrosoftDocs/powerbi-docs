# Auto-generated Captions for standalone Copilot search results

**Date:** [MM/DD/YYYY]

## Feature Overview
Power BI aims to enhance item discoverability by auto-generating captions for items lacking user-created descriptions. These AI-generated captions provide contextual information in search results within the standalone Copilot experience, improving user understanding.

## Purpose of Auto-generated Captions 
- Captions serve as “pseudo descriptions” displayed when user-created descriptions are absent for the items
-  They provide context while avoiding repetition of metadata like titles or workspace information

## Requirements for Auto-generated Captions
 - Caption generation requires the Fabric Copilot tenant setting enabled and respects cross-geo data processing settings.
 - Generated captions are always displayed without requiring creator approval and cannot be disabled by admins.

## Consumer experience
 - Captions are generated on report publishing or editing.
 - Captions appear in Power BI standalone Copilot search results if no description exists for the item
 - User-created descriptions take precedence over generated captions.

## Considerations and Limitations
 - Auto-generated captions will be available for Power BI Reports
