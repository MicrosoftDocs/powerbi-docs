# Create automated status rules for goals in the Power BI service

[!INCLUDE [applies-no-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-no-desktop-yes-service.md)]

Metrics in Power BI let customers curate their goals and track them against key business objectives, in a single pane. You can automate status updates based on rules that govern that metric. Rules trigger changes based on value, percentage of target met, date conditions, or a combination of the three, making the rules as versatile as possible.

## Connected goals

For connected goals, these status rules are refreshed every time the data in your scorecard is refreshed. For manual goals, they're refreshed every time you perform a check-in.

## Get started creating automated rules

1. In **Edit** mode for the scorecard, select **More options (...)** > **See details** next to the metric.

1. The last setting is based on your first dropdown, either **Value** or **Date**.  

    If you chose **Value**, you can either set the value or the percent or target met.

### More about status rules

- With automated status rules, you can create multiple conditions to ensure your rules represent your unique business needs. You can also drag the rules to reorder the priority.  
- For the mobile experience, automatic refresh on status rules isn't supported at this time.
