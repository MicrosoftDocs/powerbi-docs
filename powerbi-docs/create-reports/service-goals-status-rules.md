# Create automated status rules for goals in the Power BI service

[!INCLUDE [applies-no-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-no-desktop-yes-service.md)]

Metrics in Power BI let customers curate their goals and track them against key business objectives, in a single pane. You can automate status updates based on rules that govern that metric. Rules trigger changes based on value, percentage of target met, date conditions, or a combination of the three, making the rules as versatile as possible.

## Connected goals

For connected goals, these status rules are refreshed every time the data in your scorecard is refreshed. For manual goals, they're refreshed every time you perform a check-in.

## Get started creating automated rules

1. In **Edit** mode for the scorecard, select **More options (...)** > **See details** next to the metric.

1. On the **Status rules** tab, select **New rule**.

1. In the first field, you can select the dropdown caret and choose to base your rule on **Date** instead of **Value**.

1. The last setting is based on your first dropdown, either **Value** or **Date**.  

    If you chose **Value**, you can either set the value or the percent or target met.

    If you selected **Date** in the first dropdown, you can select the date you want to base your rule on.

1. Now set the status that should be shown when the rules are met, and also the **Otherwise** status.

### More about status rules

- With automated status rules, you can create multiple conditions to ensure your rules represent your unique business needs. You can also drag the rules to reorder the priority.  
- For the mobile experience, automatic refresh on status rules isn't supported at this time.
