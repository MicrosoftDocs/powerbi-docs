# Troubleshooting sign-in issues for Power BI

This article describes how to get [support](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/support/) when you are experiencing Power BI sign-in issues.

The first action you need to take is to **engage your organization's internal support team** for assistance.

However, if you are a **tenant admin** for your organization and you still can't sign into Power BI, then continue with the information below.

## Engage the support team

First, try to create a support ticket through the [Power BI support page](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/support/).

If you are unable to go through the Power BI support page, then try to create a ticket via the [Office 365 (O365) support page](https://support.office.com/home/contact).

If you're unable to create a ticket either through the Power BI support page or through O365, then try to contact support via phone.

* For customers in the United States (US) and the rest of the Americas: +1-800-936-5800
* For customers in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia (EMEA): +44-844-800-2400
* For customers in India: +1-800-419-5666

Another option to contact Microsoft support for help is by purchasing [Microsoft Premier support](https://support.microsoft.com/premier). If you know your organization has purchased Microsoft Premier support and you still can't create a case from any Power BI or O365 channel, then you can contact Premier support via phone.

* For customers in the United States (US) and the rest of the Americas: +1-800-936-3100
* For customers in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia (EMEA): +44-844-800-8338
* For customers in India: +1-800-425-5666

> [!Note]
> It is helpful to provide [additional diagnostic information](service-admin-capturing-additional-diagnostic-information-for-power-bi.md) at the time you engage support.

## Power BI community

If you're unable to create a forum post on the community page, it's because the [Power BI community forum](https://community.powerbi.com/) also requires you to sign in.

> [!Note]
> See [Community Support](https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Community-Support/ct-p/PBI_CommunitySupport) for additional details.
