# Troubleshooting sign-in issues for Power BI

This article describes how admins can contact support for Power BI sign-in issues. If you're a Power BI user having sign-in issues, first engage your organization's internal support team for assistance.

However, if you're a **tenant admin** for your organization, and you still can't sign into Power BI, then continue with the information below.

## Contact Microsoft support

First, try to create a support ticket through the [Power BI support page](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/support/).

If you're unable to go through the Power BI support page, then try to create a ticket via the [Office 365 support page](https://support.office.com/home/contact).

If you're unable to create a ticket either through either of these pages, then try to contact support over the phone:

* For customers in the United States (US) and the rest of the Americas: +1-800-936-5800
* For customers in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia (EMEA): +44-844-800-2400
* For customers in India: +1-800-419-5666

Another option to contact Microsoft support for help is by purchasing [Microsoft Premier support](https://support.microsoft.com/premier). If you know your organization has purchased Microsoft Premier support and you still can't create a case from any Power BI or Office 365 channel, then you can contact Premier support over the  phone:

* For customers in the United States (US) and the rest of the Americas: +1-800-936-3100
* For customers in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia (EMEA): +44-844-800-8338
* For customers in India: +1-800-425-5666

> [!Note]
> It is helpful to provide [additional diagnostic information](service-admin-capturing-additional-diagnostic-information-for-power-bi.md) at the time you engage support.

## Power BI community

If you're unable to create a post in the Power BI community forum, it's because the forum also requires you to sign in. See [Community Support](https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Community-Support/ct-p/PBI_CommunitySupport) for additional details.
