# Troubleshooting sign-in issues for Power BI

This article describes how to generate [support content](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/support/) that details what path you can follow to resolve your sign in issues.

The first action you need to take is to **engage your internal support team** for assistance. However, if you are a **tenant admin** for your organization, and you until can't sign into Power BI then continue with the information below.

## Engage the support team

First, try to create a support ticket through the [Power BI support page](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/support/).

If you are unable to go through the Power BI support page, then try to create a ticket via the [Office 365 (O365) support page](https://support.office.com/home/contact).

If you're unable to create a ticket either through the Power BI support page or through O365, then try to contact support via phone.
* For customers in the United States (US) and the rest of the Americas: +1-800-936-5800
* For customers in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia (EMEA): +44-844-800-2400
* For customers in India: +1-800-419-5666

Another option to contact Microsoft support for help is by purchasing [Microsoft Premier support](https://support.microsoft.com/premier). If you know your organization has purchased Microsoft Premier support and you still can't create a case from any O365 or Power BI channel, then you can contact Premier support via phone.
* For customers in the United States (US) and the rest of the Americas: +1-800-936-3100
* For customers in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia (EMEA): +44-844-800-8338
* For customers in India: +1-800-425-5666

> [!Note]
> It is helpful to provide [additional diagnostic information](service-admin-capturing-additional-diagnostic-information-for-power-bi.md) at the time you engage support.

## Power BI community

If you're unable to create a forum post on the community page, it's because the [Power BI community forum](https://community.powerbi.com/) also requires you to sign in.

## Next steps

Here are a few sites you can visit for additional Power BI support:

* [Power BI Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/)
* [Creating Power BI Support Cases](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/charles_sterling/2017/12/01/creating-power-bi-support-cases/)
