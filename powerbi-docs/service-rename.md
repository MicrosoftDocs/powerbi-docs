## Rename a dashboard, report, or workbook
1. Start in a workspace and select the **Dashboards**, **Reports**, or **Workbooks** tab. Hover over the item to rename, and select the gear icon ![gear icon](media/service-rename/powerbi-cog-icon.png). If there is no gear icon, you do not have permissions to rename.

2. On the Settings page, type the new name and select **Save**.

## Rename a dataset
1. Start in a workspace and select the **Datasets** tab.
   
   ![workspace Datasets tab](media/service-rename/power-bi-ellipses.png)
2. Hover over the item to rename, select the ellipses (...), and choose **Rename**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The options in the dropdown will vary.

3. On the Settings page, type a new name and select **Save**.

## Rename an App workspace
Anyone with Admin permissions can rename an app workspace.

1. Start in the workspace you'd like to rename.
2. In the top-right corner, select the ellipses (...) and choose **Edit workspace**. If you don't see this option, then you don't have permissions to rename this workspace. 
   
    ![select Edit workspace](media/service-rename/power-bi-edit-workspace.png)
3. Type a new workspace name and select **Save**.

## Rename a page in a report
Don't like the name of a page in your Power BI report?  A new name is just a click away. Pages can be renamed in [report Editing view ](service-interact-with-a-report-in-editing-view.md).

1. Open the report in [Editing View](consumer/end-user-reading-view.md).
2. Locate the report page tabs at the bottom of the Power BI window.
   
    ![report with tabs highlighted](media/service-rename/report-page-tabs-new.png)
3. Open the report page that you'd like to rename by selecting the tab.
4. Double-click the name on the tab to highlight it.

5. Type a new report page name and select ENTER.
   
    ![type new page name](media/service-rename/new-name.png)

## Considerations and troubleshooting
* If the item to be renamed has been shared with you, or is part of a content pack, you won't see the gear icon and you won't have access to Settings.
* On the **Datasets** tab, if you don't see the ellipses (...), expand your browser window.
