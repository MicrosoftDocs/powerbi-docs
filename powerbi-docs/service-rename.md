## Rename a dashboard, report, or workbook
1. Start in a workspace and select the **Dashboards**, **Reports**, or **Workbooks** tab. Hover over the item to rename, and select the gear icon ![](media/service-rename/powerbi-cog-icon.png). If there is no gear icon, you do not have permissions to rename.

## Rename an App workspace
Anyone with Admin permissions can rename an app workspace.

1. Start in the workspace you'd like to rename.
2. In the top-right corner, select the ellipses (...) and choose **Edit workspace**. If you don't see this option, then you don't have permissions to rename this workspace.

3. Type a new workspace name and select **Save**.

## Rename a page in a report
Don't like the name of a page in your Power BI report?  A new name is just a click away. Pages can be renamed in [report Editing view ](service-interact-with-a-report-in-editing-view.md).

1. Open the report in [Editing View](service-reading-view-and-editing-view.md).
2. Locate the report page tabs at the bottom of the Power BI window.

3. Open the report page that you'd like to rename by selecting the tab.
4. Double-click the name on the tab to highlight it.

5. Type a new report page name and select ENTER.

## Considerations and troubleshooting
* If the item to be renamed has been shared with you, or is part of a content pack, you won't see the gear icon and you won't have access to Settings.
* On the **Datasets** tab, if you don't see the ellipses (...), expand your browser window.
