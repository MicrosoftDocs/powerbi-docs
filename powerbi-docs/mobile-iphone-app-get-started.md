# Get started with the Power BI mobile app on an iPhone or iPod Touch
The Microsoft Power BI for iOS app on the iPhone or iPod Touch delivers the mobile BI experience for Power BI, Power BI Report Server, and Reporting Services. View and interact with your company dashboards on premises and in the cloud from anywhere, with live, touch-enabled mobile access. Explore the data in dashboards, and share with your colleagues in email or text messages. And keep up to date with your most timely data on your [Apple Watch](mobile-apple-watch.md).  

![Power BI iphone mobile app dashboard](media/mobile-iphone-app-get-started/power-bi-mobile-get-started-dash.png)

You create Power BI reports in Power BI Desktop, and publish them:

* [Publish them to the Power BI service](service-get-started.md), and create dashboards.
* [Publish them on-premises to Power BI Report Server](report-server/quickstart-create-powerbi-report.md).

Then in the Power BI app for the iPhone, you interact with your dashboards and reports, whether on-premises or in the cloud.

Find out [what's new in the Power Bi mobile apps](powerbi-mobile-whats-new-in-the-mobile-apps.md).

## Download the app
[Download the iOS app](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=522062 "Download the iPhone app")  from the Apple App Store to your iPhone or iPod Touch.

> [!NOTE]
> You can run the Power BI for iOS app on iPhone 5 and above, with iOS 9.0 or later. You can also run it on an iPod Touch with iOS 9.0 or later.
> 
> 

## Sign up for the Power BI service
Go to Power BI (https://powerbi.com) for the service, if you haven't already. It's free.

## Get started with the Power BI app
1. In the iPhone, open the Power BI app.
2. To view your Power BI dashboards, tap **Power BI**.  
   To view your Reporting Services mobile reports and KPIs, tap **SQL Server Reporting Services**.
   
   ![Log in to the Power BI mobile app](media/mobile-iphone-app-get-started/power-bi-connect-to-login.png)
   
   When you're in the app, just tap the global navigation button ![Global navigation button](media/mobile-iphone-app-get-started/power-bi-iphone-global-nav-button.png) in the upper-left corner to go between the two. 

## Try the Power BI and Reporting Services samples
Even without signing up, you can play with the Power BI and Reporting Services samples. After you download the app, you can view the samples or get started. Go back to the samples whenever you want from the global navigation.

### Power BI samples
You can view and interact with the Power BI dashboard samples, but there are a few things you can't do with them. You can't open the reports behind the dashboards, share the samples with others, or make them your favorites.

## Find your content in the Power BI mobile apps
Your dashboards and reports are stored in different locations in the Power BI mobile apps, depending on where they came from. Read  about [finding your content in the mobile apps](mobile-apps-find-content-mobile-devices.md). Plus you can always search for anything you have in the Power BI mobile apps.

## Enterprise support for the Power BI mobile apps
Organizations can use Microsoft Intune to manage devices and applications, including the Power BI mobile apps for Android and iOS.

Microsoft Intune lets organizations control items like requiring an access pin, controlling how data is handled by the application, and even encrypting application data when the app isn't in use.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use the Power BI mobile app on your iPhone and your organization has configured Microsoft Intune MAM, then background data refresh is turned off. The next time you enter the app, Power BI refreshes the data from the Power BI service on the web.
> 
> 

Read more about [configuring Power BI mobile apps with Microsoft Intune](service-admin-mobile-intune.md).
