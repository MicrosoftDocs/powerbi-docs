![](media/service-recent/power-bi-recent-screen.png)

## What is recent content
Recent content is the last 20 items you visited.  This includes: dashboards, reports, apps, and workbooks.

## Display recent content
To see your five most-recently visited items, from the left navigation, select the arrow to the right of **Recent**.  From here you can select recent content to open it. Only the five most-recent items are listed.

If you have more than five recently-visited items, select **See all** to open the Recent screen (see below). You can also select **Recent**, or the Recent ![](media/service-recent/power-bi-recent-icon.png)  icon, from the left nav.

From here you can interact with the content as you would on the individual [**Dashboards**](service-dashboards.md), [**Reports**](service-reports.md), and **Workbooks** tabs, and on the [**Apps**](service-install-use-apps.md) screen.
