# Use auditing within your organization

Knowing who is taking what action on which item in your Power BI tenant can be critical in helping your organization fulfill its requirements, like meeting regulatory compliance and records management. Use Power BI auditing to audit actions done by users, like "View Report" and "View Dashboard". You can't use auditing to audit permissions.

You work with auditing in the Office 365 Security and Compliance Center or use PowerShell. Auditing relies on functionality in Exchange Online, which is automatically provisioned to support Power BI.

You can filter the audit data by date range, user, dashboard, report, dataset, and activity type. You can also download the activities in a csv (comma-separated value) file to analyze offline.

## Requirements

You must meet these requirements to access audit logs:

* You must either be a global admin or assigned the Audit Logs or View-Only Audit Logs role in Exchange Online to access the audit log. By default, the Compliance Management and Organization Management role groups come with these roles assigned on the **Permissions** page in the Exchange admin center.

    To provide non-admin accounts with access to the audit log, you must add the user as a member of one of these role groups. If you want to do it another way, you can create a custom role group in the Exchange admin center, assign the Audit Logs or View-Only Audit Logs role to this group, and then add the non-admin account to the new role group. For more information, see [Manage role groups in Exchange Online](/Exchange/permissions-exo/role-groups).

    If you can't access the Exchange admin center from the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to https://outlook.office365.com/ecp and sign in using your credentials.

* If you have access to the audit log but aren't a global admin or Power BI Service admin, you won't have access to the Power BI Admin portal. In this case, you must use a direct link to the [Office 365 Security & Compliance Center](https://sip.protection.office.com/#/unifiedauditlog).

## Access your audit logs

To access logs, first make sure to enable logging in Power BI. For more information, see [Audit logs](service-admin-portal.md#audit-logs) in the admin portal documentation. There can be up to a 48 hour delay between the time you enable auditing and when you can view audit data. If you don't see data immediately, check the audit logs later. There can be a similar delay between getting permission to view audit logs and being able to access the logs.

The Power BI audit logs are available directly through the [Office 365 Security & Compliance Center](https://sip.protection.office.com/#/unifiedauditlog). There's also a link from the Power BI admin portal:

1. In Power BI, select the **gear icon** in the upper-right corner, then select **Admin portal**.

   ![Screenshot of the gear drop-down menu with the Admin portal option called out.](media/service-admin-auditing/powerbi-admin.png)

1. Select **Audit logs**.

1. Select **Go to O365 Admin Center**.

   ![Screenshot of the Admin portal with the Audit logs option and the Go to Microsoft O365 Admin Center options called out.](media/service-admin-auditing/audit-log-o365-admin-center.png)

## Search only Power BI activities

Restrict results to only Power BI activities by following these steps. For a list of activities, see the list of [activities audited by Power BI](#activities-audited-by-power-bi) later in this article.

1. On the **Audit log search** page, under **Search**, select the drop-down for **Activities**.

2. Select **Power BI activities**.

   ![Screenshot of Audit log search with Power BI activities called out.](media/service-admin-auditing/audit-log-search-filter-by-powerbi.png)

3. Select anywhere outside of the selection box to close it.

Your searches will only return Power BI activities.

## Search the audit logs by date

You can search the logs by date range using the **Start date** and **End date** fields. The default selection is the past seven days. The display presents the date and time in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. The maximum date range that you can specify is 90 days. 

You'll receive an error if the selected date range is greater than 90 days. If you're using the maximum date range of 90 days, select the current time for **Start date**. Otherwise, you'll receive an error saying that the start date is earlier than the end date. If you've turned on auditing within the last 90 days, the date range can't start before the date that auditing was turned on.

![Screenshot of Audit log search with Start Date and End Date options called out.](media/service-admin-auditing/search-audit-log-by-date.png)

## Search the audit logs by users

You can search for audit log entries for activities done by specific users. Enter one or more user names in the **Users** field. The user name looks like an email address. It's the account that users log into Power BI with. Leave this box blank to return entries for all users (and service accounts) in your organization.

![Search by users](media/service-admin-auditing/search-audit-log-by-user.png)

## View search results

After you select **Search**, the search results load. After a few moments, they display under **Results**. When the search finishes, the display shows the number of results found. **Audit log search** displays a maximum of 1000 events. If more than 1000 events meet the search criteria, the app displays the newest 1000 events.

### View the main results

The **Results** area has the following information for each event returned by the search. Select a column header under **Results** to sort the results.

| **Column** | **Definition** |
| --- | --- |
| Date |The date and time (in UTC format) when the event occurred. |
| IP address |The IP address of the device used for the logged activity. The app displays the IP address in either an IPv4 or IPv6 address format. |
| User |The user (or service account) who performed the action that triggered the event. |
| Activity |The activity performed by the user. This value corresponds to the activities that you selected in the **Activities** drop down list. For an event from the Exchange admin audit log, the value in this column is an Exchange cmdlet. |
| Item |The object created or modified because of the corresponding activity. For example, the  viewed or modified file, or the updated user account. Not all activities have a value in this column. |
| Detail |Additional detail about an activity. Again, not all activities have a value. |

### View the details for an event

To view more details about an event, select the event record in the list of search results. A **Details** page appears that has the detailed properties from the event record. The **Details** page displays properties depending on the Office 365 service in which the event occurs.

To display these details, select **More information**. All Power BI entries have a value of 20 for the RecordType property. For information about other properties, see [Detailed properties in the audit log](/office365/securitycompliance/detailed-properties-in-the-office-365-audit-log/).

   ![Screenshot of the audit details dialog with the More information option called out.](media/service-admin-auditing/audit-details.png)

## Export search results

To export the Power BI audit log to a CSV file, follow these steps.

1. Select **Export results**.

1. Select either **Save loaded results** or **Download all results**.

    ![Screenshot of the Export results option.](media/service-admin-auditing/export-auditing-results.png)

## Use PowerShell to search audit logs

You can also use PowerShell to access the audit logs based on your login. The following example shows how to connect to Exchange Online PowerShell and then use the [Search-UnifiedAuditLog](/powershell/module/exchange/policy-and-compliance-audit/search-unifiedauditlog?view=exchange-ps/) command to pull Power BI audit log entries. To run the script, an admin must assign you the appropriate permissions, as described in the [Requirements](#requirements) section.

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

$UserCredential = Get-Credential

$Session = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https://outlook.office365.com/powershell-liveid/ -Credential $UserCredential -Authentication Basic -AllowRedirection

Import-PSSession $Session
Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate 9/11/2018 -EndDate 9/15/2018 -RecordType PowerBI -ResultSize 1000 | Format-Table | More
```

## Use PowerShell to export audit logs

You can also use PowerShell to export the results of your audit logs search. The following example shows how to send from the [Search-UnifiedAuditLog](/powershell/module/exchange/policy-and-compliance-audit/search-unifiedauditlog?view=exchange-ps/) command, and export the results using the [Export-Csv](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/export-csv) cmdlet. To run the script, an admin must assign you the appropriate permissions, as described in the [Requirements](#requirements) section.

```powershell
$UserCredential = Get-Credential

$Session = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https://outlook.office365.com/powershell-liveid/ -Credential $UserCredential -Authentication Basic -AllowRedirection

Import-PSSession $Session
Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate 9/11/2019 -EndDate 9/15/2019 -RecordType PowerBI -ResultSize 5000 |
Export-Csv -Path "c:\temp\PowerBIAuditLog.csv" -NoTypeInformation

Remove-PSSession $Session
```
