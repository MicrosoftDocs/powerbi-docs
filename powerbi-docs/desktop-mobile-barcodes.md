# Tag barcodes in Power BI Desktop for the mobile apps

In Power BI Desktop, you can [categorize data](desktop-data-categorization.md) in a column, so Power BI Desktop knows how to treat values in visuals in a report. You can also categorize a column as **Barcode**. When you or your colleagues [scan a barcode on a product with the Power BI app](consumer/mobile/mobile-apps-scan-barcode-iphone.md) on the iPhone, you see any report that includes that barcode. When you open the report in the mobile app, Power BI automatically filters the report to data related to that barcode.

1. In Power BI Desktop, switch to Data View.
2. Select a column with barcode data. See the list of [supported barcode formats](#supported-barcode-formats) below.
3. On the **Modeling** tab, select **Data Category** > **Barcode**.

4. In Report view, add this field to the visuals you want filtered by the barcode.
5. Save the report and publish it to the Power BI service.

Now when you open the scanner on the [Power BI app for iPhone](consumer/mobile/mobile-iphone-app-get-started.md) and scan a barcode, you see this report in the list of reports. When you open the report, its visuals are filtered by the product barcode you scanned.
