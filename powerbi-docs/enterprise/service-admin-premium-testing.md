# Purchase Power BI Premium for testing

This article describes how to purchase Power BI Premium A SKUs for testing scenarios, and for cases where you don't have the permissions necessary to purchase P SKUs (Microsoft 365 Global Administrator role or Billing Administrator role). A SKUs require no time commitment, and are billed hourly. You purchase A SKUs in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

For more information about Power BI Premium, see [What is Power BI Premium?](service-premium-gen2-what-is.md). For current pricing and planning information, see the [Power BI pricing page](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/pricing/). Content creators still need a [Power BI Pro license](service-admin-purchasing-power-bi-pro.md), even if your organization uses Power BI Premium. Ensure you purchase at least one Power BI Pro license for your organization. With A SKUs, _all users_ who consume content also require Pro licenses.

> [!NOTE]
> If a Premium subscription expires, you have 30 days of full access to your capacity. After that, your content reverts to a shared capacity. Models that are greater than 1 GB are not supported in shared capacity.

## Purchase A SKUs for testing and other scenarios

A SKUs are made available through the Azure Power BI Embedded service. You can use A SKUs in the following ways:

- Enable embedding of Power BI in third party applications. For more information, see [Power BI Embedded](../developer/embedded/embedded-analytics-power-bi.md).

- Test Premium functionality before you buy a P SKU.

- Create development and test environments alongside a production environment that uses P SKUs.

- Purchase Power BI Premium even though you're not a Microsoft 365 Global Administrator role or Billing Administrator role.

> [!NOTE]
> If you purchase an A4 or higher SKU, you can take advantage of all Premium features except for unlimited sharing of content. With A SKUs, _all users_ who consume content require Pro licenses.

Follow these steps to purchase A SKUs in the Azure portal:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with an account that has at least capacity admin permissions in Power BI.

1. Search for _Power BI Embedded_ and select the service in the search results.

1. Select **Create Power BI Embedded**.

1. On the **Power BI Embedded** create screen, specify the following information:

    - The **Subscription** in which to create the Power BI Embedded service.

    - The physical **Location** in which to create the resource group that contains the service. For better performance, this location should be close to the location of your Azure Active Directory tenant for Power BI.

    - The existing **Resource group** to use, or create a new one as shown in the example.

    - The **Power BI capacity administrator**. The capacity admin must be a member user or a service principal in your Azure AD tenant.

1. If you want to use all features of Power BI Premium (except unlimited sharing), you need at at least an A4 SKU. Select **Change size**.

1. Select a capacity size of A4, A5, or A6, which correspond to P1, P2, and P3. Prices in the following image are examples only.

1. On the management screen, review the options you have for managing the service, including pausing the service when you're not using it.

After you purchase capacity, learn how to [manage capacities](service-admin-premium-manage.md#manage-capacity) and [assign workspaces](service-admin-premium-manage.md#assign-a-workspace-to-a-capacity) to a capacity.
