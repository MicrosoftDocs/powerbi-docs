# Purchase and assign Power BI Pro user licenses

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This article is for administrators. To upgrade to a Power BI Pro license, go to [Get started with Power BI Pro](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2106428&clcid=0x409&cmpid=pbidocs-purchasing-power-bi-pro) to set up your account.

This article explains how to purchase Power BI Pro user licenses in the Microsoft 365 admin center. After purchasing, you can assign licenses to users from either the Microsoft 365 admin center or the Azure portal.

Power BI Pro is an individual user license that lets users read and interact with reports and dashboards that others have published to the Power BI service. Users with this license can share content and collaborate with other Power BI Pro users. Only Power BI Pro users can publish or share content with other users or use content that's created by others, unless a Power BI Premium capacity hosts that content. For more information about the available types of licenses and subscriptions, including Premium Per User (PPU) licenses, see [Power BI licensing in your organization](service-admin-licensing-organization.md).

Self-service purchase, subscription, and license management capabilities for Power Platform products (Power BI, Power Apps, and Power Automate) are available for commercial cloud customers. For more information:
