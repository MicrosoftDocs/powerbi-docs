# Purchase and assign Power BI paid user licenses

This article is for administrators and explains how to purchase paid user licenses for Power BI and Fabric in the Microsoft 365 admin center. After purchasing, you assign licenses to users from either the Microsoft 365 admin center or from the Azure portal. Some organizations make licenses available for self-service upgrade and purchase by the organization's users. [And, some organizations don't make licenses available for self-service or they might even put an alternate processes in place](./service-admin-disable-self-service.md). 

> [!NOTE]
>The Power BI service is available as a standalone service and as one of the services that's integrated with [Microsoft Fabric](/fabric/get-started/microsoft-fabric-overview). Administration and licensing of the Power BI service is now integrated with Microsoft Fabric.

To learn about license types, including Pro and Premium Per User (PPU), see [Licensing for Fabric and Power BI](/power-bi/fundamentals/service-features-license-type).
