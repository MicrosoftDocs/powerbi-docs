# Organizational licenses and subscriptions for Fabric and Power BI 

There are two ways for users to get a license, from an administrator or by using self-service. This article is for the administrators, who purchase and manage services and licenses.

Billing administrators can sign up for the Power BI service and Fabric. After signing up and purchasing a subscription or a free trial, Billing, License, and User administrators assign licenses to users in their organization.

If you give them permissions, users in your organization can get one of the organization's licenses simply by signing in to Power BI (app.powerbi.com) or Fabric (app.fabric.microsoft.com). When a user signs in, they automatically receive a license. Administrators can set these permissions by following [Enable and disable self-service](../enterprise/service-admin-disable-self-service.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you're an individual, you can sign up for your own free, Pro, Premium Per User, trial licenses or trial of a Fabric capacity. This process is called *self-service.* To learn more, see [the self-service process](../fundamentals/service-self-service-signup-purchase-for-power-bi.md). 

## Fabric and the Power BI service

Power BI is available as a standalone SaaS service and as one of the services integrated with [Microsoft Fabric](/fabric/get-started/microsoft-fabric-overview). Administration and licensing of the Power BI service is now integrated with Microsoft Fabric.

## Licenses and subscriptions
Fabric and the Power BI service are both SaaS platforms and require licenses and at least one capacity subscription. There are some differences in how these licenses and capacities are acquired.

### Power BI licenses

Use of the Power BI service requires a license and a capacity. 

- [Per user license](../fundamentals/service-features-license-type.md#power-bi-service-licenses) - Per user licenses, allow users to work in the Power BI service. The options are Fabric (Free), Pro, and Premium Per User (PPU).

- [Capacity subscription](../fundamentals/service-features-license-type.md#premium-capacity) - There are two types of Power BI subscriptions for organizations: standard and Premium. Premium provides enhancements to Power BI, and a comprehensive portfolio of [Premium features](service-premium-features.md). Power BI Premium is a tenant-level Microsoft 365 subscription, available in a choice of SKUs (Stock Keeping Units).

Each Microsoft 365 E5 subscription includes standard capacity and a Pro license. 

### Fabric licenses

To access the Fabric SaaS platform, you need a license and a capacity.  

- [Per user license](/fabric/enterprise/licenses#per-user-licenses): Per user licenses allow users to work in Fabric. The options are Fabric (Free), Pro, and Premium Per User (PPU). The two Power BI licenses apply to using the Power BI workload in Fabric.
- [Capacity license](/fabric/enterprise/licenses#capacity-license) - An organizational license that provides a pool of resources for Fabric operations. Capacity licenses are divided into stock keeping units (SKUs). Each SKU provides a different number of capacity units (CUs) which are used to calculate the capacity's compute power. Fabric capacities are available for purchase and for trial.

## Which admins can purchase licenses and subscriptions

### Admin roles for purchasing licenses and subscriptions

You must belong to the Billing admin role to purchase or assign licenses for your organization. Admin roles are assigned from the Microsoft Entra admin center or the Microsoft 365 admin center. For more information about admin roles in Microsoft Entra ID, see [View and assign administrator roles in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-manage-roles-portal). To learn more about admin roles in Microsoft 365, including best practices, see [About admin roles](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles).

### Admin roles for managing licenses and subscriptions

After the licenses and subscriptions are purchased, License, or User admins can manage licenses for an organization. For details about these admin roles, see [Admin roles.](/fabric/admin/microsoft-fabric-admin#microsoft-365-admin-roles)

- The guest user must have the proper licensing in place to view the shared content.
