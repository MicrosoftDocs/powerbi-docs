# Power BI - operated by 21Vianet in China

Microsoft Power BI service operated by 21Vianet is designed to comply with regulatory requirements in China. The services are a physically separated environment of cloud services operated and transacted currently by a local operator, Shanghai Blue Cloud Technology Co., Ltd (“21Vianet”). This operator is a wholly owned subsidiary of Beijing 21Vianet Broadband Data Center Co., Ltd. located in mainland China.

To accommodate the requirements of regional cloud customers, Power BI operated by 21Vianet plans differ from commercial plans in some respects. We attempt to make features available within 30 days of general availability. However in some cases, underlying dependencies prevent a feature from being available.
