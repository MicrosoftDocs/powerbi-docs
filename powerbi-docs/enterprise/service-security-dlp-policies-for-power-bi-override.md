# Overriding data loss prevention policies (preview)

The data loss prevention side pane lists all the DLP policy issues detected by a content scan of the dataset.

Each DLP policy issue is shown on a card. The card shows the policy tip, indicates what kind of sensitive data was detected, and offers actions you can take if you believe the data was falsely identified.

The action or combination of actions you see may vary depending on the policy configuration. The possible actions are described below.

* **Report an issue**: Report the issue as a false positive (that is, report that the policy has mistakenly identified non-sensitive data as sensitive).
* **Override**: Override the policy. Overriding a policy means that this policy will no longer check this dataset for sensitive data. Depending on the policy configuration, you may be required to provide a justification for the override.
* **Report and override**: Report the issue as a false positive and override the policy.

>[!NOTE]
> Any action you take will be recorded in the audit log where it can be reviewed by security admins.

>[!NOTE]
> A policy tip is there to flag sensitive infromation found in your dataset. If you are the owner of this data and find that this sensitive data is misplaced, by removing it from the dataset and refreshing/republishing the dataset, the policy will be triggered again and the tip will be removed now that sensitive data is no longer found.
