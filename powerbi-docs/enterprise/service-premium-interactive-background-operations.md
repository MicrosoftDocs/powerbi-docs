# Interactive and background operations

Power BI divides operations into two types, *interactive* and *background*. This article lists these operations and explains the difference between them

## Interactive operations

On demand requests and operations that can be triggered by user interactions with the UI, such as data model queries generated by report visuals, are classified as *interactive* operations. Theyâ€™re usually triggered by user interactions with the UI. For example, an interactive operation is triggered when a user opens a report or clicks on a slicer in a Power BI report. Interactive operations can also be triggered without interacting with the UI, for example when using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or a custom application to run a DAX query.

## Background operations

Longer running operations such as dataset or dataflow refreshes are classified as *background* operations. They can be triggered manually by a user, or automatically without user interaction. Background operations include scheduled refreshes, interactive refreshes, REST-based refreshes and XMLA-based refresh operations. Users aren't expected to wait for these operations to finish. Instead, they might come back later to check the status of the operations.

## Operation list

The table below lists the Power BI operations. It provides a short description for each operation and identifies the operation's type.

| Operation            | Description  | Workload  | Type |
|----------------------|--------------|-----------|------|
| Artificial intelligence (AI) | AI function evaluation | AI |Background |
| Background query     | Queries for refreshing tiles and creating report snapshots | Datasets | Background  |
| [Dataflow DirectQuery](../transform-model/dataflows/dataflows-directquery.md) | Connect directly to a dataflow without the need to import the data into a dataset | Dataflows | Interactive |
| [Dataflow refresh](../transform-model/dataflows/dataflows-understand-optimize-refresh.md) | An on demand or scheduled background dataflow refresh, performed by the service or with REST APIs | Dataflows | Background |
| Dataset on-demand refresh | A background dataset refresh initiated by the user, using the service, REST APIs or public XMLA endpoints | Datasets | Background |
| Dataset scheduled refresh | A scheduled background dataset refresh, performed by the service, REST APIs or public XMLA endpoints | Datasets | Background |
| Full Report Email Subscription | A full exported copy of a Power BI report attached to an [email subscription](../consumer/end-user-subscribe.md) | Report | Background |
| Interactive query    | Queries initiated by an on-demand data request from a user. For example, loading a model when opening a report, or user interaction with a report | Datasets | Interactive |
| PublicApiExport | A Power BI report exported with the [Export report to file](../developer/embedded/export-to.md) REST API | Report | Background |
| Render | A Power BI paginated report exported with the [Export paginated report to file](../developer/embedded/export-paginated-report.md) REST API | Paginated report | Background |
| Render | A Power BI paginated report viewed in Power BI service | Paginated report | Interactive |
| XMLA read | XMLA read operations initiated by the user, for queries and discoveries  | Datasets | Interactive |
| XMLA write | A background XMLA write operation that changes the model | Datasets | Background |
