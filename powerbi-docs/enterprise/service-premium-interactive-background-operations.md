# Interactive and background operations

Power BI divides operations into two types, *interactive* and *background*. This article lists these operations and explains the difference between them

## Interactive operations

On demand requests and operations that can be triggered by user interactions with the UI, such as data model queries generated by report visuals, are classified as *interactive* operations. They’re usually triggered by user interactions with the UI. For example, an interactive operation is triggered when a user opens a report or clicks on a slicer in a Power BI report. Interactive operations can also be triggered without interacting with the UI, for example when using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or a custom application to run a DAX query.

## Background operations

Longer running operations such as semantic model or dataflow refreshes are classified as *background* operations. They can be triggered manually by a user, or automatically without user interaction. Background operations include scheduled refreshes, interactive refreshes, REST-based refreshes, XMLA-based refresh operations, and report subscriptions. Users aren't expected to wait for these operations to finish. Instead, they might come back later to check the status of the operations.

## Operation list

The table below lists the Power BI operations. It provides a short description for each operation and identifies the operation's type.

| Operation            | Description  | Workload  | Type |
|----------------------|--------------|-----------|------|
| Artificial intelligence (AI) | AI function evaluation | AI |Background |
| Background query     | Queries for refreshing tiles | Semantic models | Background  |
| [Dataflow DirectQuery](../transform-model/dataflows/dataflows-directquery.md) | Connect directly to a dataflow without the need to import the data into a semantic model | Dataflows | Interactive |
| [Dataflow refresh](../transform-model/dataflows/dataflows-understand-optimize-refresh.md) | An on demand or scheduled background dataflow refresh, performed by the service or with REST APIs | Dataflows | Background |
| Semantic model on-demand refresh | A background semantic model refresh initiated by the user, using the service, REST APIs or public XMLA endpoints | Semantic models | Background |
| Semantic model scheduled refresh | A scheduled background semantic model refresh, performed by the service, REST APIs or public XMLA endpoints | Semantic models | Background |
| Full report email subscription | A PDF or PowerPoint copy of an entire Power BI report, attached to an [email subscription](../collaborate-share/end-user-subscribe.md) | Report | Interactive |
| Interactive query    | Queries initiated by an on-demand data request from a user. For example, loading a model when opening a report, user interaction with a report, or Power BI report snapshots. | Semantic models | Interactive |
| PublicApiExport | A Power BI report exported with the [Export report to file](../developer/embedded/export-to.md) REST API | Report | Background |
| Render | A Power BI paginated report exported with the [Export paginated report to file](../developer/embedded/export-paginated-report.md) REST API | Paginated report | Background |
| Render | A Power BI paginated report viewed in Power BI service | Paginated report | Interactive |
| Web modeling read | A data model read operation in the semantic model web modeling user experience | Semantic models | Interactive |
| Web modeling write | A data model write operation in the semantic model web modeling user experience  | Semantic models | Interactive |
| VNet Data Gateway Uptime | A query run through a virtual network data gateway | Dataflows Gen2<br><br>Paginated Reports<br><br>Power Platform Dataflows<br><br>Semantic models (Datasets) | Interactive/background |
| XMLA read | XMLA read operations initiated by the user, for queries and discoveries  | Semantic models | Interactive |
| XMLA write | A background XMLA write operation that changes the model | Semantic models | Background |
