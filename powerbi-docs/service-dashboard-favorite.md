# Favorite dashboards in the Power BI service
When you make a dashboard a *favorite*,  you'll be able to access it from all of your workspaces.  Favorites are typically those that you visit most often.

> [!NOTE]
> This topic applies to Power BI service, and not to Power BI Desktop.
> 
> 

You can also select a single dashboard as a [featured dashboard](service-dashboard-featured.md) in Power BI service.

## Add a dashboard as a *favorite*
Watch Amanda add favorites to her workspace, then follow the step-by-step instructions below the video to try it out yourself.

1. Open a dashboard that you use often. Even dashboards that have been shared with you can be *favorites*.
2. From the top-right corner of Power BI service, select **Favorite** or the star ![](media/service-dashboard-favorite/power-bi-favorite-icon.png)  icon.

   You can also favorite a dashboard from your workspace **Dashboards** tab.

## Working with *favorites*
1. To acccess your favorites, from any workspace, select the flyout arrow to the right of **Favorites**.  From here you can select a favorite dashboard to open it. Only five favorites are listed (alphabetically). If you have more than five favorites, select **See all** to open the favorites screen (see #2, below).

2. To see **all** the dashboards that you have added as favorites, in the left navpane, select **Favorites** or the Favorites ![](media/service-dashboard-favorite/power-bi-favorites-icon.png)  icon.

   From here you can select a dashboard to open it, or share a dashboard with colleagues.

## Unfavorite a dashboard
No longer use a dashboard as often as you used to?  You can unfavorite it. When you unfavorite a dashboard, it is removed from your Favorites list but not from Power BI.

1. In the left navigation pane, select **Favorites** to open the **Favorites** screen.

2. Select the yellow star next to the dashboard to unfavorite.

> **NOTE**: You can also unfavorite a dashboard from the dashboard itself. In the top-right corner of the dashboard you'll see a yellow star and the word **Unfavorite**. Select either to remove that dashboard from your favorites list.
