# Change row height or column width in a paginated report (Power BI Report Builder)

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-report-builder-no-desktop](../../includes/applies-yes-report-builder-no-desktop.md)]

  When you set a row height, you are specifying the maximum height for the row in the rendered paginated report. However, by default, text boxes in the row are set to grow vertically to accommodate their data at run-time, and this can cause a row to expand beyond the height that you specify. To set a fixed row height, you must change the text box properties so they do not automatically expand.  
  
 When you set a column width, you are specifying the maximum width for the column in the rendered report. Columns do not automatically adjust horizontally to accommodate text.  
  
 If a cell in a row or column contains a rectangle or data region, the minimum height and width of the cell is determined by the height and width of the contained item. For more information, see [Rendering Behaviors &#40;Power BI Report Builder&#41;](../../paginated-reports/report-design/render-behaviors-report-builder-service.md).
