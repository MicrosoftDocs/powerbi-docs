# Hide page header or footer on first or last page of a paginated report (Power BI Report Builder)

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-report-builder-no-desktop](../../includes/applies-yes-report-builder-no-desktop.md)]

A paginated report can contain a page header and page footer that run along the top and bottom of each page, respectively. After you add a header or footer, you can selectively hide it on the first and last pages of a report.
  
## Hide a page header on the first or last page  
  
1. Open a report in Design view.  
  
1. Right-click the page header, and then select **Header Properties**. The **Report Header Properties** dialog box opens.  
  
1. Verify that **Display header for this report** is not selected.  
  
1. In the **Print options** section, clear the check box for each option to hide the display on the first or last page of the report.  
  
1. Select **OK**.
