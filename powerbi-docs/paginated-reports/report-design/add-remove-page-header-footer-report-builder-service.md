# Add or remove a page header or footer in a paginated report (Power BI Report Builder)

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-report-builder-no-desktop](../../includes/applies-yes-report-builder-no-desktop.md)]

You can add static text, images, lines, rectangles, and borders to paginated report page headers or footers. You can place expressions and data-bound images in a textbox if you want variable or computed data in a header or footer.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Each rendering extension processes page headers and footers differently. For more information, see [Page Headers and Footers &#40;Report Builder)](./page-headers-footers-report-builder-service.md) and [Pagination in Reporting Services &#40;Report Builder  and SSRS&#41;](/sql/reporting-services/report-design/pagination-in-reporting-services-report-builder-and-ssrs).
  
## Add a page header or footer  
  
1. Open a report in Power BI Report Builder.  
  
1. On the design surface, right-click the report, point to **Insert**, and then select **Header** or **Footer**.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> The **Header** and **Footer** options appear only when a header or footer is not already part of the report.  
  
## Configure a page header or footer

    - **Rectangle**  
    - **Image**  
  
1. Right-click the page header, and then select **Header Properties** to add borders, background images, or colors, or to adjust the width of the header. Then select **OK**.  
  
1. Right-click the page footer, and then select **Footer Properties** to add borders, background images, or colors, or to adjust the width of the footer. Then select **OK**.  
  
## Remove a page header or footer  
  
1. Open the report in Power BI Report Builder.  
  
1. On the design surface, right-click the page header or footer, and then select **Delete**.  
  
> [!NOTE]
