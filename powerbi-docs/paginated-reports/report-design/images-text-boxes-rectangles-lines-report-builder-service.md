# Images, text boxes, rectangles, and lines in a paginated report (Power BI Report Builder)

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-report-builder-no-desktop](../../includes/applies-yes-report-builder-no-desktop.md)]

  In addition to data regions like tables, matrices, and charts, Power BI paginated reports use other report items like images, text boxes, and rectangles to add visual interest, highlight key information, or provide related information. You can change the formatting of a report item. For example, you can add a border or padding, change the initial visibility or direction, or specify an exact size and location for the item.  
  
## In this section

 [Text boxes &#40;Power BI Report Builder and service&#41;](./textbox/text-boxes-report-builder-and-service.md)  
 Text boxes can be placed anywhere on a report and can contain labels, fields, or calculated data. You use expressions to define the value to display in a text box when you view a report.  
  
 Every cell in a table or matrix is also a text box, which you can format in the same way that you format stand-alone text boxes.  
  
 [Rectangles and lines &#40;Power BI Report Builder and service&#41;](/sql/reporting-services/report-design/rectangles-and-lines-report-builder-and-ssrs)  
 **Lines** display horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. A line is defined with a start and end point and can have various styles (for example, weight and color) assigned to it. A line has no data associated with it.  
  
 **Rectangles** can be used as a graphical element, or as a container for other report items. As a graphical element, a rectangle has the same properties as a line. As a container, a rectangle acts as a parent container for all report items inside it. Placing report items in a parent container helps control how they appear on each report page.  
  
 [Images &#40;Power BI Report Builder and service&#41;](./images-report-builder-service.md)  
 Images display binary image data in a report. You provide the source for the image. The source can be a URL reference to an external image available over internet without needing authentication or additional sign-in, a reference to embedded image data, or a reference to binary image data in a database. Report Builder and Report Designer support .bmp, .jpeg, .gif, and .png files.
