# Format lines, colors, and images in a paginated report (Power BI Report Builder)

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-report-builder-no-desktop](../../includes/applies-yes-report-builder-no-desktop.md)]

Power BI Report Builder gives you the ability to format lines, colors, data regions, images, and other report items in a  Power BI paginated report.  

## Borders, lines and gridlines  

 Borders, lines, and gridlines can visually tie items together on the page and help your report readers easily read the contents of the report. Using the predefined border styles, you can quickly add a border around a text box, a group of text boxes, or an image. In addition, you can change the style, width, and color for the borders, lines, and gridlines. Borders are added around the entire item selected or around a border along an edge of the item, for example, a border along the bottom of a text box.  
  
 To format borders and gridlines in a text box, report layout, or around an image, use the **Border** tab of the report item's **Properties** dialog box. For example, if you want to add a border around an image, right-click the image and then in the **Image Properties** dialog box, select **Border**.  
  
 In addition to the standard border frames, additional border frames can be applied to charts. For more information, see [Add a Border Frame to a Chart &#40;Power BI Report Builder and service&#41;](/sql/reporting-services/report-design/add-a-border-frame-to-a-chart-report-builder-and-ssrs).
  
 You can also add a border to the report itself. For more information, see [Add a Border to a Report &#40;Power BI Report Builder and service&#41;](/sql/reporting-services/report-design/add-a-border-to-a-report-report-builder-and-ssrs).  
  
## Apply background colors

 A solid color can be added to the background of the entire report, a text box within the report, or to a cell or group of cells within a data region. By default, the background color is white; however, you can select a color from the **Fill** tab of the report item's **Properties** dialog box. For example, if you want to change the background color of a text box, right-click the text box and select **Text Box Properties**. Select **Fill** and then select the color you want. In this dialog box, you can select a background color for the selected item or you can add an image that appears in the background.  
  
 When you use the chart, you can also specify gradients and pattern styles for background colors. For more information, see [Formatting a Chart &#40;Power BI Report Builder&#41;](/sql/reporting-services/report-design/formatting-a-chart-report-builder-and-ssrs).
  
## Use images as formatting

 Fields that contain images can be added to a data region. If you use an image field, the images appear in the report when the report is run.  
  
 You can also add images such as logos to the background of your report or to a rectangle, text box, table, matrix, or some parts of a chart, or to the body and page sections of a report. For more information, see [Images &#40;Power BI Report Builder and service&#41;](./images-report-builder-service.md).
