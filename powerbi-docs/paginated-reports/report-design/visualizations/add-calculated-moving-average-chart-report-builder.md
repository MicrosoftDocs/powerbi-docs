# Add a calculated moving average to a series on a chart (Power BI Report Builder)

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-report-builder-no-desktop](../../../includes/applies-yes-report-builder-no-desktop.md)]

A moving average is an average of the data in your series, calculated over a defined period of time. In Power BI paginated reports, the moving average can be shown on the chart to identify significant trends.

To add a moving average to a chart:
  
1. Right-click on a field in the **Values** area of the chart and select **Add Calculated Series**, as shown in the following image. The **Calculated Series Properties** dialog opens.

1. Specify an integer value for the **Period** that represents the period of the moving average.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > The period is the number of days used to calculate a moving average. If date/time values aren't specified on the x-axis, the period is represented by the number of data points used to calculate a moving average. If there's only one data point, the moving average formula doesn't calculate. The moving average is calculated starting at the second point. If you specify the **Start from first point** option, the chart will start the moving average at the first point. If there's only one data point, the point in the calculated moving average will be identical to the first point in your original series.
