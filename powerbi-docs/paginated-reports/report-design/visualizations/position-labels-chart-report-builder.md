# Position labels in a paginated report chart (Power BI Report Builder)

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-report-builder-no-desktop](../../../includes/applies-yes-report-builder-no-desktop.md)]

Because each chart type in a Power BI paginated report has a different shape, data point labels are placed in an optimal location so as not to interfere on the chart. The default position of the labels varies with the chart type:  
  
- On stacked charts, labels can only be positioned inside the series.  
- On funnel or pyramid charts, labels are placed on the outside in a column.  
- On pie charts, labels are placed inside the individual slices on a pie chart.  
- On bar charts, labels are placed outside of the bars that represent data points.  
- On polar charts, labels are placed outside of the circular area that represents data points.
