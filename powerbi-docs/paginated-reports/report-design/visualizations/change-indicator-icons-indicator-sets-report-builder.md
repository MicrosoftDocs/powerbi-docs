# Change indicator icons and indicator sets in Power BI paginated reports (Power BI Report Builder)

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-report-builder-no-desktop](../../../includes/applies-yes-report-builder-no-desktop.md)]

  The pre-configured indicators sets that are provided for Power BI paginated reports might not always depict your data effectively and work well in the delivered report. This topic provides procedures to change the appearance of indicator icons and change the indicator sets to include different, more, or fewer indicator icons.  
  
 Options such as colors can be set by using expressions. For more information, see [Expressions &#40;Power BI Report Builder&#41;](/sql/reporting-services/report-design/expressions-report-builder-and-ssrs).  
  
## Change the color of an indicator icon

2.  Select **Values and States** in the left pane.  
  
3.  Select the down arrow in the **Color** column next to the icon that you want to change and select the color to use, **No Color**, or **More colors**.  
  
     Optionally, select the **Expression** (*fx*) button to edit an expression that sets the value of the **Color** option.  
  
     If you selected **More Colors**, the **Select Color** dialog box opens, where you can choose from a wide array of colors. For more information about its options, see [Select Color Dialog Box &#40;Power BI Report Builder&#41;](/sql/reporting-services/report-design/formatting-lines-colors-and-images-report-builder-and-ssrs).

    -   To use an image that is stored externally to the report, select **Browse** and locate the image. The report will include a reference to the image.
