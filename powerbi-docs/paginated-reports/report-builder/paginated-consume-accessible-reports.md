## Consume a paginated report in the Power BI service by using a screen reader

A screen reader reads aloud every object on the report as you navigate through the paginated report in service. It reads aloud each report object, its description and the Alt text provided by the report creator.

> [!NOTE]
> The screen reader doesn't read Alt texts for images aloud in Power BI service.
 
## Consume Accessible PDF paginated report by using a screen reader

As you navigate to the different objects in an Accessible PDF report using the <kbd>Up</kbd> and <kbd>Down</kbd> arrow keys, the screen reader reads aloud the object value, its description and the Alt text if any was provided by the report creator.
To consume a Table or Matrix in an Accessible PDF report, navigate through each cell using the <kbd>Up</kbd> and <kbd>Down</kbd> arrow keys. Depending on the screen reader used, it reads aloud the row number, the column name and then the cell value of each cell you navigate to. 

> [!NOTE]
> When using a screen reader alongside the keyboard to navigate through the report objects, the cursor (blinking line) isn't highlighted on the object in focus. You can only tell the object in focus when navigating by what the screen reader reads aloud.
