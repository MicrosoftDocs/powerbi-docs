# Add, change, or delete a map or map layer in a Power BI paginated report (Power BI Report Builder)

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-report-builder-no-desktop](../../includes/applies-yes-report-builder-no-desktop.md)]

  A map is a collection of layers. When you add a map to a Power BI paginated report, you define the first layer. You can create additional layers by using the map layer wizard.  
  
 The easiest way to add, remove, or change options for a layer is to use the map layer wizard. You can also change options manually from the Map pane. To display the **Map** pane, select in the map on the report design surface. The following figure displays the parts of the pane:  
  
 ![Screenshot of the Map Layers section that points out the Layer Toolbar, Layer visibility, Layer name, Type of spacial data source, Layer type, Adjust Zoom Level, and Adjust View Center options.](../media/paginated-reports-maps/map-layer-zone.png)  
  
 Map layers are drawn from bottom to top in the order that they appear in the Map pane. In the previous figure, the tile layer is drawn first and the polygon layer is drawn last. Layers that are drawn later might hide map elements on layers that are drawn earlier. You can change the order of layers by using the arrow keys on the Map pane toolbar. To show or hide layers, toggle the visibility icon. You can change the transparency of a layer on the **Visibility** page of the **Layer Data** properties dialog box.  
  
The following table displays the toolbar icons for the **Map** pane.
