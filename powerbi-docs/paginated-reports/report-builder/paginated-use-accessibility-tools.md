# Use accessibility tools to create accessible paginated reports (Power BI Report Builder)

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-report-builder-no-desktop](../../includes/applies-yes-report-builder-no-desktop.md)]

Power BI Report Builder has an inclusive design, which makes it accessible to people with disabilities as well as people without disabilities. Individuals who have physical disabilities, low-vision or temporal disabilities can also use Power BI Report Builder to create paginated reports.

:::image type="content" source="media/paginated-use-accessibility-tools/report-builder-accessible-toolbar.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Accessible toolbar.":::

This article describes the types of accessibility tools available for report creators for creating paginated reports.

## Accessibility tools for creating paginated reports

The accessibility tools that are compatible with Power BI Report Builder and can be used by report creators to create accessible paginated reports include the following:

- Screen reader
- Keyboard navigation

In the following sections we would look at these tools in detail.

### Screen reader

Power BI Report Builder is screen reader compatible; report creators with low or no vision can use it for creating paginated reports. As the report creator navigates the various levels of the app, the screen reader reads out the object in focus. A screen-reader can also help in navigating the dialogs in Power BI Report Builder. When a dialog box is displayed, the screen reader reads aloud the menu context as the user navigates it.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Use the wizards to create tables or chart elements while using a screen reader to create your report. The screen reader will be able to read out all the items, making the process easier and less confusing than when creating them from scratch.

### Keyboard navigation

As a report creator, you can use the keyboard to navigate and create a paginated report in Power BI Report Builder. 
This section describes how to navigate the various levels of the app while creating your report.

## App-level navigation

When navigating in Power BI Report Builder, you can move focus to the main areas of the app by pressing <kbd>F6</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F6</kbd>. Shifting focus in the main area of Power BI Report Builder progresses in the following order:

1. The ribbon
1. Data pane
1. Report design surface
1. Grouping pane
1. Properties pane

## Ribbon navigation

To navigate the Ribbon, press the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key and you’ll see little boxes called KeyTips appear over each command available in the current view of the ribbon. Then you can press the letter shown in the KeyTip that hovers over the command you want to use.

In the following image, the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key was pressed to display the KeyTips that contains the letters for accessible commands. Pressing <kbd>I</kbd> opens the Insert tab on the ribbon.

:::image type="content" source="media/paginated-use-accessibility-tools/report-builder-accessible-toolbar.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Accessible toolbar.":::
 
Depending on which letter you press, you will see other KeyTips for other functions under the tab selected. For example, if you press H, the Home tab is displayed along with the KeyTips for the groups in that Home ribbon tab as shown in the following image. You can then press the letters or numbers displayed in KeyTips for the specific command you want to use.

To move to the previous set of KeyTips, press Esc. To cancel the action you’re taking and hide the KeyTips, press the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key.

## Report Data pane navigation

If the Report Data pane is not visible, you can make it visible by pressing <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>. To navigate the Report Data pane, make sure your focus is on the pane by pressing <kbd>F6</kbd> until you reach that pane.
When you navigate to the Report Data pane, the focus first lands on the toolbar of the pane. To switch between the toolbar options, use <kbd>Left</kbd> and <kbd>Right</kbd> arrow keys.

You can move focus from the Report Data pane toolbar to the first item in Report Data pane Built-in Fields by using the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key as seen in the image above.
When the focus is on the first item on the Report Data pane, you can then use <kbd>Up</kbd> and <kbd>Down</kbd> arrow keys to navigate to a particular item on the Report Data pane. To Expand any item, use <kbd>Right</kbd> arrow key, while the <kbd>Left</kbd> arrow key can be used to collapse any item. A screen reader reads out the items as you move across them stating if it is collapsed or expanded.

## Properties pane navigation

If the Properties Pane is not visible, you can make it visible by pressing <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>. To navigate the Properties pane, make sure your focus is on the pane by pressing <kbd>F6</kbd> until you reach that pane.

To switch to other toolbar options, use <kbd>Left</kbd> and <kbd>Right</kbd> arrow keys, a screen reader reads out the options as you move across them.

:::image type="content" source="media/paginated-use-accessibility-tools/report-builder-properties-pane.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Properties pane.":::

The tab order starts from the top in the following order:

1. Properties pane toolbar
1. Property name
1. The value of the property selected.

 

Use the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key to move focus from the toolbar to Properties categories, then you can use the <kbd>Up</kbd> and <kbd>Down</kbd> arrow keys to navigate to a particular property. The <kbd>Tab</kbd> key can be used to move focus from a property name to its value. To Expand any property, use the <kbd>Right</kbd> arrow key while the <kbd>Left</kbd> arrow key can be used to collapse any property. A screen reader reads out the property you have selected and whether it is collapsed or expanded. For property value with a drop-down selection option, simply move the focus to the dropdown with the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key and then click on the <kbd>Space bar</kbd> and the dropdown options will be displayed.
