## Accessibility standards

To accommodate a variety of users and adhere to accessibility guidelines and regulations, you can create paginated reports that conform to the following accessibility standards.
 
### WCAG 2.1 

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are guidelines for making web content accessible to people with disabilities. These four principles are the WCAG guidelines:

- **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.  

    Keeping your paginated reports simple, using contrasting colors and avoiding information overload. 

- **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable. 

    Paginated reports are operable using keyboard navigation. 

- **Understandable**: Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.  

    Providing clear text alternatives or descriptions where they're necessary.  

- **Robust**: Content can be interpreted by a wide range of user agents including assistive technologies.  

    Paginated reports support the use of screen readers. 

### US Accessibility Conformance

US Accessibility Conformance requires governments and federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities. 

### EN 301 549 

EN 301 549 is the Harmonized European Standard for Accessibility requirements for Information and Communication Technology (ICT) products and services. 

### ISO 14289-1 (PDF/UA) 

ISO 14289-1 is the ISO standard for Universal Accessibility requirements for universally accessible PDF documents. For more info about this, see [PDF Rendering Extension conformance to ISO 14289-1 - paginated reports](../../report-server/rendering-extension-support.md).
