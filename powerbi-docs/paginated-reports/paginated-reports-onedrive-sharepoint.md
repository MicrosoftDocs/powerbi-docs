# Send large report subscriptions to OneDrive SharePoint

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-service-no-report-builder-no-power-bi-desktop](../includes/applies-yes-service-no-report-builder-no-desktop.md)]

You can send all of your large reports, both Power BI (.pbix) and paginated reports, to OneDrive SharePoint.

Subscribe to your Power BI and paginated reports to deliver them to OneDrive SharePoint. Your full report gets delivered to the OneDrive SharePoint location that you can select when you set up your subscription.

## Requirements

The requirements apply to users in the organization. To create a subscription, you need:

- Permissions to access the report.
- Access to a workspace backed by a [Premium capacity](../enterprise/service-premium-what-is.md) or equivalent [Fabric capacity](/fabric/enterprise/licenses#microsoft-fabric-license-types). 

Your Fabric admin (previously Power BI admin) needs to enable subscriptions in your tenant. If youâ€™re an admin, see [Enable subscriptions in the Power BI admin portal](/fabric/admin/service-admin-portal-export-sharing#users-can-set-up-email-subscriptions). 

## Subscribe to a report

Here's how you subscribe to a full report to be delivered to OneDrive SharePoint.

1. From the top menu bar, open a report in the Power BI service. This can be a Power BI report or a paginated report.

1. Select **Create a subscription**. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/paginated-reports-onedrive-sharepoint/power-bi-create-subscription.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing subscribe to paginated" lightbox="media/paginated-reports-onedrive-sharepoint/power-bi-create-subscription.png":::

1. We currently support Standard subscriptions. Select **Standard**.

1. Select the **Attach full report** option.

    By default:  

    - Your subscription is given the same name as your report page.  Optionally, change the name of the subscription to something more meaningful.
    - Your name is populated as the Recipient.  

1. Select the format that you want your report to be in. 

    Power BI reports support two formats:

    - PDF (.pdf)
    - Microsoft PowerPoint (.pptx)

    Paginated reports support several formats:

    - Microsoft Excel (.xlsx)
    - PDF (.pdf)
    - Accessible PDF (.pdf)
    - Microsoft PowerPoint (.pptx)
    - XML (.xml)
    - Comma-separated values (.csv)

1. Select the type of subscription. 

1. When you select **OneDrive** or **SharePoint**, select the folder location where you want the subscription to be delivered, and enter the subscription schedule to have your report delivered.

1. By default, the File Name is the same as the Subscription name. Optionally, you can change these values. Also by default, the option to append the file name with date and time is selected. You can unselect that. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/paginated-reports-onedrive-sharepoint/power-bi-file-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing in the File Name option." lightbox="media/paginated-reports-onedrive-sharepoint/power-bi-file-name.png":::
