# Power BI Report Builder

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-report-builder-no-desktop](../includes/applies-yes-report-builder-no-desktop.md)]

Power BI Report Builder is a tool for authoring *paginated reports* that you can publish to the Power BI service. Paginated reports are designed to be printed or shared. They're formatted to fit well on a page, and they display *all* the data in a table, even if the table spans multiple pages.  When you design a paginated report, you're creating a *report definition* that specifies what data to retrieve, where to get it, and how to display it. When you run the report, the report processor takes the report definition you have specified, retrieves the data, and combines it with the report layout to generate the report. You preview your report in Report Builder, and then publish your report to the Power BI service. See [What are paginated reports in Power BI?](paginated-reports-report-builder-power-bi.md) for more background.

Ready to start authoring? [Install Power BI Report Builder](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=105942) from the Microsoft Download Center.

Prefer learning from videos? Check out the [Video-based course: Power BI Paginated Reports in a Day](paginated-reports-report-builder-power-bi.md).

The following paginated report is a sample of an invoice. You can download it and other samples, such as letters, transcripts, and labels. Read more about [sample Power BI paginated reports](paginated-reports-samples.md).

## System requirements
  
See the **System requirements** section of the [Power BI Report Builder download page](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=105942) on the Microsoft Download Center.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-paginated-prerequisites](../includes/power-bi-paginated-prerequisites.md)]

## Start with the Table, Matrix, or Chart wizard

Create a data source connection, drag and drop fields to create a dataset query, select a layout and style, add accessibility row properties, and customize your report.  
  
## Start with the Map wizard

Create reports that display aggregated data against a geographic or geometric background. Map data can be spatial data from a Transact-SQL query or an Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. (ESRI) shapefile. You can also add a Microsoft Bing map tile background.  

##  <a name="DesignRept"></a> Design your report  
  
- **Create paginated reports with table, matrix, chart, and free-form report layouts**: Create table reports for column-based data, matrix reports (like cross-tab or PivotTable reports) for summarized data, chart reports for graphical data, and free-form reports for anything else. Reports can embed other reports and charts, together with lists, graphics, and controls for dynamic Web-based applications.  
  
- **Report from a variety of data sources**: You can create reports that use relational and multidimensional data from SQL Server and Analysis Services, Oracle, Power BI semantic models, and other databases.  
  
- **Modify existing reports**: By using Report Builder, you can customize and update reports that were created in SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) Report Designer.  
  
- **Modify your data**: Filter, group, and sort data, or add formulas or expressions.  

- **Add charts, gauges, sparklines, and indicators**: Summarize data in a visual format, and present large volumes of aggregated information at a glance.  
  
- **Add interactive features**: Examples include document maps, show/hide buttons, and drillthrough links to subreports and drillthrough reports. Use parameters and filters to filter data for customized views.  
  
- **Embed or reference images**: Including other resources, such as external content.  
  
##  <a name="ManageRpt"></a> Manage your report  
  
- **Save the definition of the report**: To your computer or to the report server, where you can manage it and share it with others.  
  
- **Choose a presentation format**: When you open the report or after you open the report. You can select Web-oriented, page-oriented, and desktop application formats. Formats include MHTML, PDF, XML, CSV, Word, and Excel.  
  
- **Set up subscriptions**: After you publish the report to the Power BI service, you can configure your report to run at a specific time and send as an e-mail subscription.  

## Use deployment pipelines with paginated reports

In the Power BI service, you can use the deployment pipeline tool with paginated reports. Deployment pipelines let you develop and test your Power BI paginated reports before you release them to your users. The tool is a pipeline with three stages:

- Development
- Test
- Production

Read about how to [get started with deployment pipelines](/fabric/cicd/deployment-pipelines/get-started-with-deployment-pipelines) in the Power BI service.

## Considerations and limitations

You might not be able to configure Parameters as both "Multi-value" and "Allow null". "Multi value" and "Allow blank" is an allowed combination but Null is treated differently.

## Power BI Report Builder in a virtualized environment

Power BI Report Builder is fully supported on [Azure Virtual Desktop](/azure/virtual-desktop/overview) (formerly Windows Virtual Desktop) and [Windows 365](/windows-365/overview).

Running Power BI Report Builder as a virtualized application (for example, as a Citrix application) isn't supported.
