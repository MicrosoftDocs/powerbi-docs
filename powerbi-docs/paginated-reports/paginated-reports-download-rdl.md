    If you know you have the most recent version of Power BI Report Builder, select **I've already installed these updates**.

1. Go through the Power BI Report Builder installation process: 

    1. Select **Download**.  
    2. Select **Open file** and go through the steps in the Power BI Report Builder Setup Wizard.

1. After the Report Builder installation finishes, go back to the Power BI service and select **Create paginated report**.

    The design surface also features a link to the [Power BI Paginated Reports in a Day](../learning-catalog/paginated-reports-online-course.md) video-based course. If you're new to paginated report creation, the course is a good way to get up to speed.  You can delete it when you start designing your report.

    You're ready to start designing your paginated report.
