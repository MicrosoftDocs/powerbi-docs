# Connect to SQL Sentry with Power BI
Analyzing your performance data collected by SQL Sentry is easy with Power BI. Power BI retrieves your data, then builds a default dashboard and related reports based on that data.

Connect to the [SQL Sentry content pack](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/getdata/services/sql-sentry) for Power BI.

>[!NOTE]
>Access to a SQL Sentry account you use for connecting to http://cloud.sqlsentry.com and a Database ID you will monitor is required to connect.  Instructions for where to find the Database ID are below.

## How to connect
1. Select **Get Data** at the bottom of the left navigation pane.
