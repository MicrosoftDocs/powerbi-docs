# Publish a paginated report to the Power BI service (Preview)

In this article, you learn about publishing a paginated report to the Power BI service by uploading it from your local computer. You can upload paginated reports to your My Workspace or any other workspace, as long as the workspace is in a Premium capacity. Look for the diamond icon ![Power BI Premium capacity diamond icon](media/paginated-reports-save-to-power-bi-service/premium-diamond.png) next to the workspace name. 

If your report data source is on premises, then you need to [create a gateway](#create-a-gateway-to-an-on-premises-data-source) after you upload the report.

## Add a workspace to a Premium capacity

If the workspace doesn't have the diamond icon ![Power BI Premium capacity diamond icon](media/paginated-reports-save-to-power-bi-service/premium-diamond.png) next to the name, you need to add the workspace to a Premium capacity. 

1. Select **Workspaces**, select the ellipsis (**...**) next to the workspace name, then select **Edit workspace**.

    ![Select Edit workspace](media/paginated-reports-save-to-power-bi-service/power-bi-paginated-edit-workspace.png)

1. In the **Edit workspace** dialog box, expand **Advanced**, then slide **Dedicated capacity** to **On**.

   You may not be able to change it. If not, then contact your Power BI Premium capacity admin to give you assignment rights to add your workspace to a Premium capacity.


## Upload a paginated report

1. Create your paginated report in Report Builder and save it to your local computer.

1. Open the Power BI service in a browser and browse to the Premium workspace where you want to publish the report. Note the diamond icon ![Power BI Premium capacity diamond icon](media/paginated-reports-save-to-power-bi-service/premium-diamond.png) next to the name. 

1. Select **Get Data**.

1. Select **Continue** > **Edit credentials**.

    ![Select Edit credentials](media/paginated-reports-save-to-power-bi-service/power-bi-paginated-select-edit-credentials.png)

   You see your report in the list of reports.

## Create a gateway

Just like any other Power BI report, if the report data source is on premises, then you need to create or connect to a gateway to access the data.

1. Next to the report name, select **Manage**.

   ![Manage the paginated report](media/paginated-reports-save-to-power-bi-service/power-bi-paginated-manage.png)
