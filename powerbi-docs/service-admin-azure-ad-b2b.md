# Distribute Power BI content to external guest users with Azure AD B2B

Power BI integrates with Azure Active Directory business-to-business (Azure AD B2B) to allow secure distribution of Power BI content to guest users outside your organization, while still maintaining control over the internal data.  

Additionally, you can allow guest users outside your organization to edit and manage content within your organization.

## Enable access

Make sure to enable the [Share content with external users](service-admin-portal.md#export-and-sharing-settings) feature in the Power BI admin portal before inviting guest users.

You can also use the [Allow external guest users to edit and manage content in the organization](service-admin-portal.md#allow-external-guest-users-to-edit-and-manage-content-in-the-organization) feature. It lets you select which guest user can see and create content in workspaces, including browsing your organization's Power BI.

## Who can you invite?

You can invite guest users with most email addresses, including personal accounts like gmail.com, outlook.com, and hotmail.com. Azure AD B2B calls these addresses *social identities*.

You cannot invite users that are associated with a government cloud, like [Power BI for US Government](service-govus-overview.md).

## Invite guest users

Guest users only require invitations the first time you invite them to your organization. There are two ways to invite users: planned invites and ad hoc invites.

### Planned invites

Use a planned invite if you know which users to invite. You can send the invite using the Azure portal or PowerShell. You must be a tenant admin to invite people.

Follow these steps to send an invite in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Azure Active Directory**.

1. Under **Manage**, select **Users** > **All users** > **New guest user**.

1. Enter an **email address** and **personal message**.

1. Select **Invite**.

To invite more than one guest user, use PowerShell. For more information, see [Azure AD B2B collaboration code and PowerShell samples](/azure/active-directory/b2b/code-samples/).

The guest user needs to select **Get Started** in the email invitation they receive. The guest user is then added to the tenant.

### Ad hoc invites

To invite an external user at any time, add them to your dashboard or report through the share UI, or your app through the access page. Here is an example of what to do when inviting an external user to use an app.

The guest user will receive an email indicating that you shared the app with them.

The guest user must sign in with their organization email address. They'll receive a prompt to accept the invitation after signing in. After sign in, the app opens for the guest user. To return to the app, they can bookmark the link or save the email.

## Licensing

The guest user must have the proper licensing in place to view the content that you shared. There are three ways to make sure the user has a proper license: use Power BI Premium, assign a Power BI Pro license, or use the guest's Power BI Pro license.

When using the [Allow external guest users to edit and manage content in the organization](service-admin-portal.md#allow-external-guest-users-to-edit-and-manage-content-in-the-organization) feature, guest users contributing content to workspaces or sharing content with others require a Power BI Pro license.

### Use Power BI Premium

Assigning the workspace to [Power BI Premium capacity](service-premium-what-is.md) lets the guest user use the app without requiring a Power BI Pro license. Power BI Premium also lets apps take advantage of other capabilities like increased refresh rates, dedicated capacity, and large model sizes.

### Assign a Power BI Pro license to guest user

Assigning a Power BI Pro license to the guest user, within your tenant, lets that guest user  view content in the tenant.

### Guest user brings their own Power BI Pro license

The guest user already has a Power BI Pro license assigned within their tenant.

## Guest users who can edit and manage content 

When using the [Allow external guest users to edit and manage content in the organization](service-admin-portal.md#allow-external-guest-users-to-edit-and-manage-content-in-the-organization) feature, the specified guest users get access to your organization's Power BI. They can see any content to which they have permission. They can access Home, browse workspaces, install apps, see where they are on the access list, and contribute content to workspaces. They can create or be an Admin of workspaces that use the new workspace experience. Some limitations apply. The Considerations and Limitations section list those restrictions.
 
To help these users sign in to Power BI, provide them with the Tenant URL. To find the tenant URL, follow these steps.

1. In the Power BI service, in the top menu, select help (**?**) then **About Power BI**.

2. Look for the value next to **Tenant URL**. The value is the tenant URL you can share with your guest users.

## Considerations and Limitations

* By default, external Azure AD B2B limits guests to consumption of content only. External Azure AD B2B guests can view apps, dashboards, reports, export data and create email subscriptions for dashboards and reports. They can't access workspaces or publish their own content. However, these restrictions don't apply to guest users who gain access through the [Allow external guest users to edit and manage content in the organization](service-admin-portal.md#allow-external-guest-users-to-edit-and-manage-content-in-the-organization) feature.

* To invite guest users a Power BI Pro license is needed. Pro Trial users can't invite guest users in Power BI.

* For guest users enabled through the [Allow external guest users to edit and manage content in the organization](service-admin-portal.md#allow-external-guest-users-to-edit-and-manage-content-in-the-organization) feature, some experiences aren't available to them. To update or publish reports, they need to use the Power BI service web UI, including Get Data to upload Power BI Desktop files.  The following experiences aren't supported:
    * Direct publishing from Power BI desktop to the Power BI service
    * Guest users can't use Power BI desktop to connect to service datasets in the Power BI service
    * Classic workspaces tied to Office 365 Groups:
        * Guest user can't create or be Admins of these workspaces
        * Guest users can be members
    * Sending ad hoc invites isn't supported for workspace access lists
    * Power BI Publisher for Excel isn't supported for guest users
    * Guest users can't install a Power BI Gateway and connect it to your organization
    * Guest users can't install apps publish to the entire organization
    * Guest users can't use, create, update, or install organizational content packs
    * Guest users can't use Analyze in Excel
    * Guest users can't be @mentioned in commenting
    * Guest users can't use subscriptions
    * Guest users who use this capability should have a work or school account. 
    
* Guest users using Personal accounts will experience more limitations due to sign-in restrictions.
    * They can use consumption experiences in the Power BI service through a web browser
    * They can't use the Power BI Mobile apps.
    * They won't be able to sign-in to provide credentials where a work or school account is required.

* This feature isn't currently available with the Power BI SharePoint Online report web part.

* There are Active Directory Settings that can limit what external guest users can do within your overall organization. That also applies to your Power BI environment. The following documentation discusses the settings:
    * [Manage External Collaboration Settings](/azure/active-directory/b2b/delegate-invitations#configure-b2b-external-collaboration-settings)
    * [Allow or block invitations to B2B users from specific organizations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/b2b/allow-deny-list)
