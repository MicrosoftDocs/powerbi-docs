# Sign up for Power BI as an individual

Power BI can be your personal data analysis and visualization tool, and can also serve as the analytics and decision engine behind group projects, divisions, or entire corporations. This article explains how to sign up for Power BI as an individual. If you're a Power BI admin, see [Power BI licensing in your organization](service-admin-licensing-organization.md).

## Supported email addresses

Before you start the sign-up process, it's important to learn which types of email addresses that you can use to sign-up for Power BI:

* Power BI requires that you use a work or school email address to sign up. You can't sign up using email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunication providers. This includes outlook.com, hotmail.com, gmail.com, and others.

* After you sign up, you can [invite guest users](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-b2b-what-is-azure-ad-b2b) to see your Power BI content with any email address, including personal accounts.

* You can sign-up for Power BI with .gov or .mil addresses, but this requires a different process. For more info, see [Enroll your US Government organization in the Power BI service](service-govus-signup.md).

## Sign up for a Power BI account

Follow these steps to sign up for a Power BI account. Once you complete this process you will have a Power BI (free) license which you can use to try Power BI on your own using My Workspace, consume content from a Power BI workspace assigned to a Power BI Premium capacity or initiate an individual Power BI Pro Trial. For more information, see [Power BI features by license type](service-features-license-type.md). 

1. Go to the [sign-up page](https://signup.microsoft.com/signup?sku=a403ebcc-fae0-4ca2-8c8c-7a907fd6c235).

1. Enter your email address then select **Sign up**.

## Trial expiration

After you comnplete the sign up process, you can sign up for a Power BI Pro trial in the Power BI service. When that trial expires, your license changes back to a Power BI (free) license. After this happens, you no longer have access to features that require a Power BI Pro license. For more information, see [Features by license type](service-features-license-type.md).

If a Power BI (free) license is sufficient, you don't have to do anything else. To take advantage of Power BI Pro features, contact your IT admin about purchasing a Power BI Pro license.

## Troubleshooting the sign-up process

In most cases, you can sign up for Power BI by following the described process. Some of the issues that may prevent you from signing up are described in the following table, with possible workarounds.

| Symptom / Error Message | Cause and Workaround |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| <strong>Personal email addresses (for example nancy@gmail.com)</strong> You'll receive a message similar to this one during signup: <br /><br /> *You entered a personal email address: Please enter your work email address so we can securely store your company's data.* <br /><br /> or <br /><br /> *That looks like a personal email address. Enter your work address so we can connect you with others in your company. And don’t worry. We won’t share your address with anyone.* | Power BI doesn't support email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunications providers. <br /><br /> To finish signing up, try again using an email address assigned by your work or school. <br /><br /> If you still can't sign up and are willing to complete a more advanced setup process, you can [register for a new Office 365 trial subscription and use that email address to sign up](service-admin-signing-up-for-power-bi-with-a-new-office-365-trial.md). <br /><br /> You can also have an existing user [invite you as a guest](service-admin-azure-ad-b2b.md). |
| **Self-service signup disabled**: You receive a message like this one during signup: <br /><br /> *We can't finish signing you up. Your IT department has turned off signup for Microsoft Power BI. Contact them to complete signup.* <br /><br /> or <br /><br /> *That looks like a personal email address. Enter your work address so we can connect you with others in your company. And don’t worry. We won’t share your address with anyone.* | Your organization’s IT admin has disabled self-service signup for Power BI. <br /><br /> To finish signing up, contact your IT admin and ask them to [follow the instructions to enable sign-up](service-admin-licensing-organization.md#enable-or-disable-individual-user-sign-up-in-azure-active-directory). <br/><br/> You may also experience this problem if you [signed up for Office 365 through a partner](service-admin-syndication-partner.md). |
| **Email address isn't an Office 365 ID** You receive a message like this one during signup: <br /><br /> *We can't find you at contoso.com.  Do you use a different ID at work or school? <br /><br /> Try signing in with that, and if it doesn't work, contact your IT department.* | Your organization uses IDs to sign in to Office 365 and other Microsoft services that are different than your email address.  For example, your email address might be Nancy.Smith@contoso.com but your ID is nancys@contoso.com. <br /><br /> To finish signing up, use the ID that your organization has assigned to you for signing in to Office 365 or other Microsoft services.  If you don't know what this is, contact your IT admin. <br /><br /> If you still can't sign up and are willing to complete a more advanced setup process, you can [register for a new Office 365 trial subscription and use that email address to sign up](service-admin-signing-up-for-power-bi-with-a-new-office-365-trial.md). |
