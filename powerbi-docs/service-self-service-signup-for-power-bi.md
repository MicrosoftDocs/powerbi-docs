Learn how to sign up for Power BI and begin using it for your personal report and visualization needs.

![](media/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi/dashboard-report.png "Power BI dashboard and report")

Power BI can be your personal report and visualization tool, and can also serve as the analytics and decision engine behind group projects, divisions, or entire corporations.

This article will walk you through your options on how to sign up and begin using the Power BI service. For information on the differences between Power BI Free and Pro, see [Power BI Free vs Pro](service-free-vs-pro.md).

## You have a few options
As an individual you have several options to sign up and begin using Power BI. You can choose to sign up for free or you can purchase a Power BI Pro subscription. If you sign up for a free account, once you are in the service, you can opt into a free 60 day trial of Power BI Pro.

If you are part of an existing organization, that uses Office 365, you can still sign up for a free account. Your IT Admin also has some options to purchase Power BI Pro and assign licenses. For more information about what options are available as an IT Admin, see [Purchasing Power BI Pro](service-admin-purchasing-power-bi-pro.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you are in an organization, individual sign up may be disabled. If you get an error indicating that sign up is disabled, contact your IT department for more information.

## What you need to sign up?

In order to sign up for Power BI, you need a working email address. A personal email address will not work when trying to sign up for Power BI.

### What email address can be used with Power BI?
Power BI requires that you use a work, or school, email address to sign up. You cannot sign up got Power BI using email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunication providers. This includes outlook.com, hotmail.com, gmail.com and others.

## Which one do you need?
You can determine which one you need by reviewing what comes with each license type. Free users have most of the functionality of the services with the exception of sharing and collaboration features. Power BI Pro users can make use of all features in the service, but is not free. If you don't have a need to share any content, Free may be the route for you. You can learn more on the [Power BI Pricing page](https://powerbi.microsoft.com//pricing/).
