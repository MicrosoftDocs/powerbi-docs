# Create and manage relationships in Power BI Desktop
When you import multiple tables, chances are you'll do some analysis using data from all those tables. Relationships between those tables are necessary to accurately calculate results and display the correct information in your reports. Power BI Desktop makes creating those relationships easy. In fact, in most cases you won’t have to do anything, the autodetect feature does it for you. However, sometimes you might have to create relationships yourself, or need to make changes to a relationship. Either way, it’s important to understand relationships in Power BI Desktop and how to create and edit them.

## Autodetect during load
If you query two or more tables at the same time, when the data is loaded, Power BI Desktop attempts to find and create relationships for you. The relationship options **Cardinality**, **Cross filter direction**, and **Make this relationship active** are automatically set. Power BI Desktop looks at column names in the tables you're querying to determine if there are any potential relationships. If there are, those relationships are created automatically. If Power BI Desktop can't determine with a high level of confidence there's a match, it doesn't create the relationship. However, you can still use the **Manage relationships** dialog box to manually create or edit relationships.

## Create a relationship with autodetect
On the **Home** tab, select **Manage Relationships** \> **Autodetect**.

![Create a relationship with autodetect](media/desktop-create-and-manage-relationships/automaticrelationship.gif)

## Create a relationship manually
1. On the **Home** tab, select **Manage Relationships** \> **New**.

2. In the **Create relationship** dialog box, in the first table drop-down list, select a table. Select the column you want to use in the relationship.

3. In the second table drop-down list, select the other table you want in the relationship. Select the other column you want to use, and then elect **OK**.

   ![Create a manual relationship](media/desktop-create-and-manage-relationships/manualrelationship2.gif)

By default, Power BI Desktop automatically configures the options **Cardinality** (direction), **Cross filter direction**, and **Make this relationship active** for your new relationship. However, you can change these settings if necessary. For more information, see [Understanding additional options](#understanding-additional-options).

If none of the tables selected for the relationship has unique values, you'll see the following error: *One of the columns must have unique values*. At least one table in a relationship *must* have a distinct, unique list of key values, which is a common requirement for all relational database technologies. 

If you encounter that error, there are a couple ways to fix the issue:

* Use **Remove Duplicates** to create a column with unique values. The drawback to this approach is that you might lose information when duplicate rows are removed; often a key (row) is duplicated for good reason.
* Add an intermediary table made of the list of distinct key values to the model, which will then be linked to both original columns in the relationship.

## Edit a relationship
1. On the **Home** tab, select **Manage Relationships**.

2. In the **Manage relationships** dialog box, select the relationship, then select **Edit**.

## Configure additional options
When you create or edit a relationship, you can configure additional options. By default, Power BI Desktop automatically configures additional options based on its best guess, which can be different for each relationship based on the data in the columns.

### Cardinality
The **Cardinality** option can have one of the following settings:

**Many to one (\*:1)**: A many-to-one relationship is the most common, default type of realtionship. It means the column in one table can have more than one instance of a value, and the other related table, often know as the lookup table, has only one instance of a value.

**One to one (1:1)**: In a one-to-one relationship, the column in one table has only one instance of a particular value, and the other related table has only one instance of a particular value.

**One to many (1:*)**: In a one-to-many relationship, the column in one table has only one instance of a particular value, and the other related table can have more than one instance of a value.

**Many to many (\*:\*)**: With composite models, you can establish a many-to-many relationship between tables, which removes requirements for unique values in tables. It also removes previous workarounds, such as introducing new tables only to establish relationships. For more information, see [Relationships with a many-many cardinality](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/desktop-many-to-many-relationships). 

For more information about when to change cardinality, see [Understanding additional options](#understanding-additional-options).

### Cross filter direction
The **Cross filter direction** option can have one the following settings:

**Both**: For filtering purposes, both tables are treated as if they're a single table. The **Both** setting works well with a single table that has a number of lookup tables that surround it. An example is a sales actuals table with a lookup table for its department. This configuration is often called a star schema configuration (a central table with several lookup tables). However, if you have two or more tables that also have lookup tables (with some in common) then you wouldn't want to use the **Both** setting. To continue the previous example, in this case, you also have a budget sales table that records target budget for each department. And, the department table is connected to both the sales and the budget table. Avoid the **Both** setting for this kind of configuration.

**Single**: The most common, default direction, which means filtering choices in connected tables work on the table where values are being aggregated. If you import a Power Pivot in Excel 2013 or earlier data model, all relationships will have a single direction. 

For more information about when to change cross filter direction, see [Understanding additional options](#understanding-additional-options).

### Make this relationship active
When checked, the relationship serves as the active, default relationship. In cases where there is more than one relationship between two tables, the active relationship provides a way for Power BI Desktop to automatically create visualizations that include both tables.

For more information about when to make a particular relationship active, see [Understanding additional options](#understanding-additional-options).

## Understanding relationships
Once you've connected two tables together with a relationship, you can work with the data in both tables as if they were a single table, freeing you from having to worry about relationship details, or flattening those tables into a single table before importing them. In many situations, Power BI Desktop can automatically create relationships for you. However, if Power BI Desktop can’t determine with a high-degree of certainty that a relationship between two tables should exist, it doesn't automatically create the relationship. In that case, you must do so. 

Let’s go through a quick tutorial, to better show you how relationships work in Power BI Desktop.

>[!TIP]
>You can complete this lesson yourself: 
>
> 1. Copy the following **ProjectHours** table into an Excel worksheet (excluding the title), select all of the cells, and then select **Insert** \> **Table**. 
> 2. In the **Create Table** dialog box, select **OK**. 
> 3. Select any table cell, select **Table Design** \> **Table Name**, and then enter *ProjectHours*. 
> 4. Do the same for the **CompanyProject** table. 
> 5. Import the data by using **Get Data** in Power BI Desktop. Select the two tables as a data source, and then select **Load**.

The first table, **ProjectHours**, is a record of work tickets that record the number of hours a person has worked on a particular project. 

**ProjectHours**

| **Ticket** | **SubmittedBy** | **Hours** | **Project** | **DateSubmit** |
| ---:|:--- | ---:|:--- | ---:|
| 1001 |Brewer, Alan |22 |Blue |1/1/2013 |
| 1002 |Brewer, Alan |26 |Red |2/1/2013 |
| 1003 |Ito, Shu |34 |Yellow |12/4/2012 |
| 1004 |Brewer, Alan |13 |Orange |1/2/2012 |
| 1005 |Bowen, Eli |29 |Purple |10/1/2013 |
| 1006 |Bento, Nuno |35 |Green |2/1/2013 |
| 1007 |Hamilton, David |10 |Yellow |10/1/2013 |
| 1008 |Han, Mu |28 |Orange |1/2/2012 |
| 1009 |Ito, Shu |22 |Purple |2/1/2013 |
| 1010 |Bowen, Eli |28 |Green |10/1/2013 |
| 1011 |Bowen, Eli |9 |Blue |10/15/2013 |

This second table, **CompanyProject**, is a list of projects with an assigned priority: A, B, or C. 

**CompanyProject**

| **ProjName** | **Priority** |
| --- | --- |
| Blue |A |
| Red |B |
| Green |C |
| Yellow |C |
| Purple |B |
| Orange |C |

Notice that each table has a project column. Each is named slightly different, but the values look like they’re the same. That’s important, and we’ll get back to it in soon.

Now that we have our two tables imported into a model, let’s create a report. The first thing we want to get is the number of hours submitted by project priority, so we select **Priority** and **Hours** from the **Fields** pane.

![Select Priority and Hours from Fields pane](media/desktop-create-and-manage-relationships/candmrel_reportfiltersnorel.png)

If we look at our table in the report canvas, you’ll see the number of hours is 256 for each project, which is also the total. Clearly this number isn’t correct. Why? It’s because we can’t calculate a sum total of values from one table (**Hours** in the **Project** table), sliced by values in another table (**Priority** in the **CompanyProject** table) without a relationship between these two tables.

So, let’s create a relationship between these two tables.

Remember those columns we saw in both tables with a project name, but with values that look alike? We'll use these two columns to create a relationship between our tables.

Why these columns? Well, if we look at the **Project** column in the **ProjectHours** table, we see values like Blue, Red, Yellow, Orange, and so on. In fact, we see several rows that have the same value. In effect, we have many color values for **Project**.

If we look at the **ProjName** column in the **CompanyProject** table, we see there’s only one of each of the color values for the project name. Each color value in this table is unique, and that’s important, because we can create a relationship between these two tables. In this case, a many-to-one relationship. In a many-to-one relationship, at least one column in one of the tables must contain unique values. There are some additional options for some relationships, which we'll look at later. For now, let’s create a relationship between the project columns in each of our two tables.

### To create the new relationship
1. Select **Manage Relationships** from the **Home** tab.
2. In **Manage relationships**, select **New** to open the **Create relationship** dialog box, where we can select the tables, columns, and any additional settings we want for our relationship.
3. In the first drop-down list, select **ProjectHours** as the first table, then select the **Project** column. This side is the *many* side of our relationship.
4. In the second drop-down list, **CompanyProject** is preselected as the second table. Select the **ProjName** column. This side is the *one* side of our relationship. 
5. Accept the defaults for the relationship options, and then select **OK**.

   ![Create relationship dialog box](media/desktop-create-and-manage-relationships/candmrel_create_compproj.png)

6. In the **Manage relationships** dialog box, select **Close**.

In the interest of full disclosure, you just created this relationship the hard way. You could have just selected **Autodetect** in the **Manage relationships** dialog box. In fact, autodetect would have automatically created the relationship for you when you loaded the data if both columns had the same name. But, what’s the challenge in that?

Now, let’s look at the table in our report canvas again.

![Created relationship with Priority and Hours](media/desktop-create-and-manage-relationships/candmrel_reportfilterswithrel.png)

That looks a whole lot better, doesn’t it?

When we sum up hours by **Priority**, Power BI Desktop looks for every instance of the unique color values in the **CompanyProject** lookup table, looks for every instance of each of those values in the **ProjectHours** table, and then calculates a sum total for each unique value.

That was easy. In fact, with autodetect, you might not even have to do that much.

## Understanding additional options
When a relationship is created, either with autodetect or one you create manually, Power BI Desktop automatically configures additional options based on the data in your tables. These additional relationship options are located in the lower portion of the **Create relationship** and **Edit relationship** dialog boxes.

 ![Relationship options](media/desktop-create-and-manage-relationships/candmrel_advancedoptions2.png)

Power BI typically sets these options automatically and you won’t need to adjust them; however, there are several situations where you might want to configure these options yourself.

## Automatic relationship updates

You can manage how Power BI treats and automatically adjusts relationships in your reports and models. To specify how Power BI handles relationships options, select **File** > **Options and settings** > **Options** from Power BI Desktop, and then select **Data Load** in the left pane. The options for **Relationships** appear.

   ![Relationships options](media/desktop-create-and-manage-relationships/relationships-options-01.png)

There are three options that can be selected and enabled: 

- **Import relationships from data sources on first load**: This option is selected by default. When it's selected, Power BI checks for relationships defined in your data source, such as foreign key/primary key relationships in your data warehouse. If such relationships exist, they're mirrored into the Power BI data model when you initially load data. This option enables you to quickly begin working with your model, rather than requiring you find or define those relationships yourself.

- **Update or delete relationships when refreshing data**: This option is unselected by default. If you select it, Power BI checks for changes in data source relationships when your dataset is refreshed. If those relationships changed or are removed, Power BI mirrors those changes in its own data model, updating or deleting them to match.

   > [!WARNING]
   > If you're using row-level security that relies on the defined relationships, we don't recommend selecting this option. If you remove a relationship that your RLS settings rely on, your model might become less secure. 

- **Autodetect new relationships after data is loaded**: This option is described in [Autodetect during load](#autodetect-during-load). 


## Future updates to the data require a different cardinality
Normally, Power BI Desktop can automatically determine the best cardinality for the relationship. If you do need to override the automatic setting, because you know the data will change in the future, you can change it with the **Cardinality** control. Let’s look at an example where we need to select a different cardinality.

The **CompanyProjectPriority** table is a list of all company projects and their priority. The **ProjectBudget** table is the set of projects for which a budget has been approved.

**CompanyProjectPriority**

| **ProjName** | **Priority** |
| --- | --- |
| Blue |A |
| Red |B |
| Green |C |
| Yellow |C |
| Purple |B |
| Orange |C |

**ProjectBudget**

| **Approved Projects** | **BudgetAllocation** | **AllocationDate** |
|:--- | ---:| ---:|
| Blue |40,000 |12/1/2012 |
| Red |100,000 |12/1/2012 |
| Green |50,000 |12/1/2012 |

If we create a relationship between the **Approved Projects** column in the **ProjectBudget** table and the **ProjectName** column in the **CompanyProjectPriority** table, Power BI automatically sets **Cardinality** to **One to one (1:1)** and **Cross filter direction** to **Both**. 

 ![Create relationship between table columns](media/desktop-create-and-manage-relationships/candmrel_create_compproj_appproj2.png)

The reason Power BI makes these settings is because, to Power BI Desktop, the best combination of the two tables is as follows:

| **ProjName** | **Priority** | **BudgetAllocation** | **AllocationDate** |
|:--- | --- | ---:| ---:|
| Blue |A |40,000 |12/1/2012 |
| Red |B |100,000 |12/1/2012 |
| Green |C |50,000 |12/1/2012 |
| Yellow |C |<br /> |<br /> |
| Purple |B |<br /> |<br /> |
| Orange |C |<br /> |<br /> |

There's a one-to-one relationship between our two tables because there are no repeating values in the combined table’s **ProjName** column. The **ProjName** column is unique, because each value occurs only once; therefore, the rows from the two tables can be combined directly without any duplication.

But, let’s say you know the data will change the next time you refresh it. A refreshed version of the **ProjectBudget** table now has additional rows for the Blue and Red projects:

**ProjectBudget**

| **Approved Projects** | **BudgetAllocation** | **AllocationDate** |
| --- | ---:| ---:|
| Blue |40,000 |12/1/2012 |
| Red |100,000 |12/1/2012 |
| Green |50,000 |12/1/2012 |
| Blue |80,000 |6/1/2013 |
| Red |90,000 |6/1/2013 |

 These additional rows mean the best combination of the two tables now looks like this: 

| **ProjName** | **Priority** | **BudgetAllocation** | **AllocationDate** |
| --- | --- | ---:| ---:|
| Blue |A |40,000 |12/1/2012 |
| Red |B |100,000 |12/1/2012 |
| Green |C |50,000 |12/1/2012 |
| Yellow |C |<br /> |<br /> |
| Purple |B |<br /> |<br /> |
| Orange |C |<br /> |<br /> |
| Blue |A |80000 |6/1/2013 |
| Red |B |90000 |6/1/2013 |

In this new combined table, the **ProjName** column has repeating values. The two original tables won’t have a one-to-one relationship once the table is refreshed. In this case, because we know those future updates will cause the **ProjName** column to have duplicates, we want to set the **Cardinality** to be **Many to one (\*:1)**, with the *many* side on **ProjectBudget** and the *one* side on **CompanyProjectPriority**.

## Adjusting Cross filter direction for a complex set of tables and relationships
For most relationships, the cross filter direction is set to **Both**. There are, however, some more uncommon circumstances where you might need to set this option differently from the default, like if you’re importing a model from an older version of Power Pivot, where every relationship is set to a single direction. 

The **Both** setting enables Power BI Desktop to treat all aspects of connected tables as if they're a single table. There are some situations, however, where Power BI Desktop can't set a relationship’s cross filter direction to **Both** and also keep an unambiguous set of defaults available for reporting purposes. If a relationship cross filter direction isn't set to **Both**, then it’s usually because it would create ambiguity. If the default cross filter setting isn’t working for you, try setting it to a particular table or to **Both**.

Single direction cross filtering works for many situations. In fact, if you’ve imported a model from Power Pivot in Excel 2013 or earlier, all of the relationships will be set to single direction. Single direction means that filtering choices in connected tables work on the table where aggregation work is happening. Sometimes, understanding cross filtering can be a little difficult, so let’s look at an example.

With single direction cross filtering, if you create a report that summarizes the project hours, you can then choose to summarize (or filter) by the **CompanyProject** table and its **Priority** column or the **CompanyEmployee** table and its **City** column. If however, you want to count the number of employees per projects (a less common question), it won’t work. You’ll get a column of values that are all the same. In the following example, both relationship's cross filtering direction is set to a single direction: towards the **ProjectHours** table. In the **Values** well, the **Project** field is set to **Count**:

 ![Cross filtering direction](media/desktop-create-and-manage-relationships/candmrel_repcrossfiltersingle.png)

Filter specification will flow from **CompanyProject** to **CompanyEmployee** (as shown in the following image), but it won’t flow up to **CompanyEmployee**. 

 ![Cross filtering example](media/desktop-create-and-manage-relationships/candmrel_singledircrossfiltering.png)


However, if you set the cross filtering direction to **Both**, it will work. The **Both** setting allows the filter specification to flow up to **CompanyEmployee**.

 ![Filter specification flow](media/desktop-create-and-manage-relationships/candmrel_bidircrossfiltering.png)

With the cross filtering direction set to **Both**, our report now appears correct:

 ![Cross filtering direction set to Both](media/desktop-create-and-manage-relationships/candmrel_repcrossfilterbi.png)

Cross filtering both directions works well for a pattern of table relationships such as the pattern above. This schema is most commonly called a star schema, like this:

 ![Cross filtering both directions in star schema](media/desktop-create-and-manage-relationships/candmrel_crossfilterstarschema.png)

Cross filtering direction does not work well with a more general pattern often found in databases, like in this diagram:

 ![Cross filtering both directions in database pattern](media/desktop-create-and-manage-relationships/candmrel_crossfilterwithloops.png)

If you have a table pattern like this, with loops, then cross filtering can create an ambiguous set of relationships. For instance, if you sum up a field from TableX and then choose to filter by a field on TableY, then it’s not clear how the filter should travel, through the top table or the bottom table. A common example of this kind of pattern is with TableX as a sales table with actuals data and for TableY to be budget data. Then, the tables in the middle are lookup tables that both tables use, such as division or region. 

As with active/inactive relationships, Power BI Desktop won’t allow a relationship to be set to **Both** if it will create ambiguity in reports. There are several different ways you can handle this situation. Here are the two most common:

* Delete or mark relationships as inactive to reduce ambiguity. Then, you might be able to set a relationship cross filtering as **Both**.
* Bring in a table twice (with a different name the second time) to eliminate loops. Doing so makes the pattern of relationships like a star schema. With a star schema, all of the relationships can be set to **Both**.

## Wrong active relationship
When Power BI Desktop automatically creates relationships, it sometimes encounters more than one relationship between two tables. When this situation happens, only one of the relationships is set to be active. The active relationship serves as the default relationship, so that when you choose fields from two different tables, Power BI Desktop can automatically create a visualization for you. However, in some cases the automatically selected relationship can be wrong. Use the **Manage relationships** dialog box to set a relationship as active or inactive, or set the active relationship in the **Edit relationship** dialog box. 

To ensure there’s a default relationship, Power BI Desktop allows only a single active relationship between two tables at a given time. Therefore, you must first set the current relationship as inactive and then set the relationship you want to be active.

Let’s look at an example. The first table is **ProjectTickets**, and the second table is **EmployeeRole**.

**ProjectTickets**

| **Ticket** | **OpenedBy** | **SubmittedBy** | **Hours** | **Project** | **DateSubmit** |
| ---:|:--- |:--- | ---:|:--- | ---:|
| 1001 |Perham, Tom |Brewer, Alan |22 |Blue |1/1/2013 |
| 1002 |Roman, Daniel |Brewer, Alan |26 |Red |2/1/2013 |
| 1003 |Roth, Daniel |Ito, Shu |34 |Yellow |12/4/2012 |
| 1004 |Perham, Tom |Brewer, Alan |13 |Orange |1/2/2012 |
| 1005 |Roman, Daniel |Bowen, Eli |29 |Purple |10/1/2013 |
| 1006 |Roth, Daniel |Bento, Nuno |35 |Green |2/1/2013 |
| 1007 |Roth, Daniel |Hamilton, David |10 |Yellow |10/1/2013 |
| 1008 |Perham, Tom |Han, Mu |28 |Orange |1/2/2012 |
| 1009 |Roman, Daniel |Ito, Shu |22 |Purple |2/1/2013 |
| 1010 |Roth, Daniel |Bowen, Eli |28 |Green |10/1/2013 |
| 1011 |Perham, Tom |Bowen, Eli |9 |Blue |10/15/2013 |

**EmployeeRole**

| **Employee** | **Role** |
| --- | --- |
| Bento, Nuno |Project Manager |
| Bowen, Eli |Project Lead |
| Brewer, Alan |Project Manager |
| Hamilton, David |Project Lead |
| Han, Mu |Project Lead |
| Ito, Shu |Project Lead |
| Perham, Tom |Project Sponsor |
| Roman, Daniel |Project Sponsor |
| Roth, Daniel |Project Sponsor |

There are actually two relationships here:
- Between **Employee** in the **EmployeeRole** table and **SubmittedBy** in the **ProjectTickets** table.
- Between **OpenedBy** in the **ProjectTickets** table and **Employee** in the **EmployeeRole** table.

 ![Two-relationship example](media/desktop-create-and-manage-relationships/candmrel_activerelview.png)

If we add both relationships to the model (**OpenedBy** first), then the **Manage relationships** dialog box shows that **OpenedBy** is active:

 ![OpenedBy active in Manage relationships dialog box](media/desktop-create-and-manage-relationships/candmrel_managerelactive.png)

Now, if we create a report that uses **Role** and **Employee** fields from **EmployeeRole**, and the **Hours** field from **ProjectTickets** in a table visualization in the report canvas, we see only project sponsors because they’re the only ones that opened a project ticket.

 ![Employee, Role, and Hours fields selected](media/desktop-create-and-manage-relationships/candmrel_repcrossfilteractive.png)

We can change the active relationship and get **SubmittedBy** instead of **OpenedBy**. In **Manage relationships**, uncheck the **ProjectTickets(OpenedBy)** to **EmployeeRole(Employee)** relationship, and then check the **EmployeeRole(Employee)** to **Project Tickets(SubmittedBy)** relationship.

## See all of your relationships in Relationship view
Sometimes your model has multiple tables and complex relationships between them. **Relationship** view in Power BI Desktop shows all of the relationships in your model, their direction, and cardinality in an easy to understand and customizable diagram.
