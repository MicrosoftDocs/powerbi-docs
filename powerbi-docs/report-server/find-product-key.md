# How to find your report server product key

Learn how you can find your Power BI Report Server product key to install your server in a production environment.

You downloaded [Power BI Report Server](get-started.md), and you have a [Fabric F64+ reserved instance](/fabric/enterprise/licenses), SQL Server Enterprise Edition with Software Assurance, or SQL Server Enterprise Subscriptions. You want to install the server in a production environment, but you need a product key in order to do that. Where is the product key? The product key is in one of these places, depending on what you purchased:

- Purchased [Power BI Premium](#purchased-power-bi-premium)

- Purchased [F64+ Reserved Instance](#purchased-f64-reserved-instance) (more details on [Fabric Capacity Reservation](/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/fabric-capacity))

- Purchased [SQL Server Enterprise with Software Assurance agreement or SQL Server Enterprise Subscription](#purchased-software-assurance-agreement)

> [!NOTE]
> If you purchased your SQL Server Enterprise license through a partner, reach out to the partner to get access to the Power BI Report Server key.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't use a developer product key in a production environment.
>
> For more details, see the section "Use of Power BI Report Server â€“ SQL Server Enterprise Edition" in [SQL Server licensing](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/productoffering/SQLServer/EAEAS).
