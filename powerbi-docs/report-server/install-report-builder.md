# Install Report Builder - Power BI Report Server

Report Builder is a stand-alone app, installed on your computer by you or an administrator. You can install it from the Microsoft Download Center or from Power BI Report Server.  

Looking for help with installing Report Builder for the Power BI service? See [Power BI Report Builder](../report-builder-power-bi.md) instead.
  
An administrator typically installs and configures Power BI Report Server, grants permission to download Report Builder from the web portal, and manages folders and permissions to reports, and shared datasets saved to the report server. For more information about Power BI Report Server administration, see the [Admin overview, Power BI Report Server](admin-handbook-overview.md).  
  
## System requirements
  
 See the **System requirements** section of the [Report Builder download page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=734968) on the Microsoft Download Center.
 
## Install Report Builder from a web portal
  
You can install Report Builder from a Power BI Report Server web portal. You may already have installed Report Builder to create reports for an SSRS server.
