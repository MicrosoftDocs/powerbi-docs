### Script requirements for viewing reports
To use the report viewer, configure your browser to run scripts.

If scripting is not enabled, you will see an error message similar to the following when you open a report:

```
Your browser does not support scripts or has been configured to not allow scripts to run. Click here to view this report without scripts
```

 If you choose to view the report without script support, the report is rendered in HTML without report viewer capabilities such as the report toolbar and the document map.

> [!NOTE]
> The report toolbar is part of the HTML Viewer component. By default the toolbar appears at the top of every report that is rendered in a browser window. The report viewer provides features include the ability to search the report for information, scroll to a specific page, and adjust the page size for viewing purposes. For more information about the report toolbar or HTML Viewer, see [HTML Viewer and the Report Toolbar](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/reporting-services/html-viewer-and-the-report-toolbar).

## Browser support for Report Viewer web server controls in Visual Studio
The Report Viewer Web server control is used to embed report functionality in an ASP.NET web application. For more information on how to get the Report Viewer Control, see [Integrating Reporting Services Using Report Viewer Controls - Get Started](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/reporting-services/application-integration/integrating-reporting-services-using-reportviewer-controls-get-started).

Use a browser that has script support enabled. If the browser cannot run scripts, you cannot view the report.
