# How to configure Power BI report scheduled refresh
To refresh data in your Power BI report, a scheduled refresh plan must be created. This is done within the *Manage* area of a Power BI report.

## Configure data source credentials
Prior to creating a schedule data refresh plan, you need to set the credentials for **each data source** used in your Power BI report.

1. In the web portal, right-click on the Power BI report and select **Manage**.
   
    ![Select Manage from the Power BI report context menu](media/configure-scheduled-refresh/manage-power-bi-report.png)
2. In the left menu, select the **Data sources** tab.
3. For each data source that appears, choose the type of authentication to use when connecting to that data source. Enter the appropriate credentials.
