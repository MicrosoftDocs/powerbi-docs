# Connecting to data sources
Learn about what data sources you can connect to within Power BI Report Server.

## Power BI Reports
Power BI reports can work with data that is imported or using an Analysis Services live connection along with DirectQuery. The October 2017 release includes support for connections other than Analyssi Services live connections. This includes imported data. You can download the October 2017 release over at [powerbi.com](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/report-server/).

For information about what data soruces are supported, see [Power BI report data sources in Power BI Report Server](reportserver-data-sources.md).

## Other reports
Other report types support the same data sources that are present in SQL Server Reporting Services. For more information, see [Data sources supported by Reporting Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/reporting-services/report-data/data-sources-supported-by-reporting-services-ssrs).
