# Paginated report data sources  in Power BI Report Server
Reporting Services paginated reports in Power BI Report Server support the same data sources that are supported in SQL Server Reporting Services. See the list of [Data sources supported by Reporting Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/reporting-services/report-data/data-sources-supported-by-reporting-services-ssrs).

## Next steps
