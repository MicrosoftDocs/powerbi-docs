## 5. Version Identification

The PDF Rendering Extension provides support for PDF/UA as described in this document. In some instances, noted below, it's incumbent on the user to take steps to ensure that a PDF is in full compliance with PDF/UA.  We expect the user will add the appropriate PDF/UA version and conformance identifiers as the last step in this process, indicating that the necessary work has been done to make the PDF entirely PDF/UA compliant.

Everything listed in this document is based on rendering a PDF document with the device info setting AccessiblePdf set to `true`. In some cases, compliance limitations are due to limitations in the Report Definition Language (RDL).

## 7.  File format requirements

|     Criteria     |     Supporting Feature     |     Remarks      |
|-----|-------|------------------------|
|    7.1 General    |                 Supported with Exceptions    |    All real content shall be tagged as   defined in ISO 32000-1:2008, 14.8. Artifacts (ISO 32000-1:2008, 14.8.2.2.2)   shall not be tagged in the structure tree. <li> PDF Rendering Extension doesn't offer the flexibility   to explicitly mark individual items as artifacts, so it will instead artifact   everything that maps to the criteria in ISO 32000-1:2008, 14.8.2.2.2.<br>Content shall be marked in the structure   tree with semantically appropriate tags in a logical reading order. <br> **Note** 4   WCAG 2.0, Guideline 1.4 explains issues regarding contrast,   color, and other formatting for accessibility. <br><li> The user would need to   ensure that their document isn't subject to these issues. <br>Standard tags   defined in ISO 32000-1:2008, 14.8.4, shall not be remapped. <li> PDF   Rendering Extension doesn't remap   the standard tags. Documents begin with the Document root element. <br>Files claiming conformance with this   International Standard shall have a Suspects value   of false (ISO   32000-1:2008, Table 321). <li> PDF Rendering Extension doesn't have   the Suspects entry. This property is optional.    |
|    7.2 Text    |                 Supported with Exceptions    |    Content shall be tagged in logical   reading order. The most semantically appropriate tag shall be used for each   logical element in the document content. <br><li> PDF Rendering Extension tags   content in logical reading order as much as is feasible.<br>Character codes   shall map to Unicode as described in ISO 32000-1:2008, 14.8.2.4.2. Characters   not included in the Unicode specification may use the Unicode private use   area or declare another character encoding. <br>Natural language shall be   declared as discussed in ISO 32000-1:2008, 14.9.2 and/or as described in ISO   32000-1:2008, 7.9.2. Changes in natural language shall be declared. Changes   in natural language inside text strings (e.g. inside alternate descriptions)   shall be declared using a language identifier as described in ISO 32000-1:2008,   14.9.2.2. <br><li> PDF Rendering extension only   declares natural language at the document level    |
|    7.3 Graphics    |                 Supported with Exceptions    |    Graphics objects, other than text   objects, shall be tagged with a Figure tag   as described in ISO 32000-1:2008, 14.8.4.5, Table 340. If any of the   following exceptions are true, then the graphic shall be tagged as an   artifact: <br><li> the graphic doesn't represent meaningful content, or <li>  the graphic appears as a background to a   link annotation, in which case, the alternative text on the link shall   describe both the graphic and the link. <li> PDF Rendering Extension tags graphics objects with the   Figure tag. <br>A caption   accompanying a figure shall be tagged with a Caption   tag. <li> PDF Rendering Extension does   not currently tag captions on figures with a Caption tag. <br>Figure tags shall include an alternative   representation or replacement text that represents the contents marked with   the Figure tag as noted in ISO 32000-1:2008, 14.7.2, Table 323. <br>**Note** 1 See   also WCAG 2.0, Guideline 1.1. <br>If text represented in a graphic is   not text in a natural language that's meant to be read by a human reader,   alternative text describing the nature or purpose of the graphic shall be   provided. <br>**Note** 2 Text that's a type sample or a sample of the writing   system used by a language are examples of text that isn't in a natural   language.   PDF Rendering   Extension supports alt text on   figures, though it's up to the user to add the alt text. <br>Additional note regarding the BBox   attribute: <br><li> PDF Rendering Extension doesn't currently write the BBox   attribute. <li> A workaround is to manually retag illustrations as new Figures   or as Artifacts.    |
|    7.4 Headings    |                 Not Applicable    |    RDL doesn't support mark up of   headings in any way. It's up to the user to tag them as appropriate.    |
|    7.5 Tables    |                 Supported with Exceptions    |    Tables should include headers. Table   headers shall be tagged according to ISO 32000-1:2008, Table 337 and Table   349. <br>**Note** 1 Tables can contain column headers, row headers or both. <br>**Note**   2 As much information as possible about the structure of tables needs to be   available when assistive technology is relied upon. Headers play a key role   in providing structural information. <br><li> It's up to the user to include headers in their tables. RDL and   the PDF Rendering Extension provide support for row headers. <br>  Structure elements of type TH shall   have a Scope attribute.   <li> PDF Rendering Extension does include a Scope   attribute on TH elements for Column and Row Members, but not for Corner cells.<br>Table tagging structures shall only be   used to tag content presented within logical row and/or column relationships.   <li> This is dependent upon   how the user has chosen to use tables in their RDL.    |
|    7.6 Lists    |                 Not Applicable    |    RDL does   not support mark up of lists. In RDL, they are structurally a table with a   single table cell. <br>It's up to the user to retag them as appropriate.    |
|    7.7 Mathematical expressions    |                 Supported with Exceptions    |    All mathematical expressions shall be   enclosed within a Formula tag   as detailed in ISO 32000-1:2008, 14.8.4.5 and shall have an Alt   attribute. <br><li> PDF   Rendering Extension doesn't currently enclose   math expressions within a Formula tag. <br>The requirements regarding mapping of characters   to Unicode shall apply to mathematical expressions as set forth in ISO   32000-1:2008, 9.10.2 and 14.8.2.4. <br><li> This is supported by PDF Rendering Extension.    |
|    7.8 Page headers and footers    |                 Supported    |    Running headers and footers shall   be identified as Pagination artifacts   and shall be classified as either Header   or Footer subtypes as per ISO   32000-1:2008, 14.8.2.2.2, Table 330. <br><li> Headers or Footers are treated and tagged as artifacts.    |
|    7.9 Notes and references    |                 Not Applicable    |    PDF   Rendering Extension doesn't support mark up of notes and references. <br>It's   up to the user to tag them as appropriate.    |
|    7.10 Optional content    |                 Not Applicable    |         |
|    7.11 Embedded files    |                 Not Applicable    |         |
|    7.12 Article threads    |                 Not Applicable    |         |
|    7.13 Digital signatures    |                 Not Applicable    |         |
|    7.14 Non-interactive forms    |                 Not Applicable    |         |

|    7.16 Security    |                 Not Applicable    |         |
|    7.17 Navigation    |                 Supported    |    A document should include a   document outline that matches the reading order and level of navigational   targets (ISO 32000-1:2008, 12.3.3). <br><li> RDL supports bookmarks for a report   item, but the user must select this option. Those bookmarks are then rendered   as a document outline by the PDF Rendering Extension. <br>If present, the entries in the PageLabels number tree (ISO 32000-1:2008, 7.7.2,   Table 28) should be semantically appropriate. <br><li> The PDF Rendering Extension does   not include a PageLabels number tree.    |
|    7.18 Annotations    |                 Not Applicable    |    RDL doesn't support annotations    |
