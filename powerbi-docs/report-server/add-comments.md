# Add comments to a report in a report server - Power BI Report Server

You can add comments to reports, including Power BI reports, within the web portal of a report server. The comments live with the report, and anyone with the right permissions can see the comments for the report. See the [Permissions](#permissions) section below for details.

## Add or view comments

1. Open a paginated or Power BI report on a report server.
2. In the upper-right corner, select **Comments**.

    ![Select Comments](media/add-comments/report-server-web-portal-comments-button.png)

    In the Comments pane, you can see any existing comments.
3. Write your comment, then select **Post Comment**.

    ![Post Comment](media/add-comments/report-server-web-portal-comments-pane.png)

    Your comment shows in the pane on the web portal, along with any previous comments. They don't appear with the report on in the Power BI mobile apps.

   > [!TIP]
   > Did you know? You can [annotate Power BI reports in the Power BI mobile apps](../consumer/mobile/mobile-annotate-and-share-a-tile-from-the-mobile-apps.md) and share the annotated reports with others.
