# Tutorial: Get started with the Power BI service
This tutorial is an introduction to some of the features of the *Power BI service*. In it, you connect to data, create a report and a dashboard, and ask questions of your data. You can do much more in the Power BI service; this tutorial is just to whet your appetite. For an understanding of how the Power BI service fits in with the other Power BI offerings, we recommend reading [What is Power BI](fundamentals/power-bi-overview.md).

## Sign up for the Power BI service
If you don't have a Power BI account, [sign up for a free Power BI Pro trial](https://app.powerbi.com/signupredirect?pbi_source=web) before you begin.

After you have an account, enter *app.powerbi.com* in your browser to open the Power BI service. 

## Step 1: Get data

Often when you want to create a Power BI report, you start in Power BI Desktop. This time, we're going to start from scratch creating a report in the Power BI service.

In this tutorial, we get data from a CSV file. Want to follow along? [Download the Financial Sample CSV file](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=521962).

1. [Sign in to Power BI](https://www.powerbi.com/). Donâ€™t have an account? No worries, you can sign up for a free trial.
2. Power BI opens in your browser. Select **Get data** at the bottom of the nav pane.

    The **Get Data** page opens.   

3. Under the **Create new content** section, select **Files**. 
   
   ![Get files](media/service-get-started/gs1.png)
4.  Select **Local file**.
   
    ![Get Data > Files screen](media/service-get-started/power-bi-service-get-data-local-file.png)

5. Browse to the file on your computer, and choose **Open**.

5. For this tutorial, we select **Import** to add the Excel file as a dataset, which we can then use to create reports and dashboards. If you select **Upload**, the entire Excel workbook is uploaded to Power BI, where you can open and edit it in Excel online.
   
   ![Choose Import](media/service-get-started/power-bi-import.png)
6. When your dataset is ready, select **Datasets**, then select **Create report** next to the dataset **Financial sample** to open the report editor. 

    ![Datasets list](media/service-get-started/power-bi-service-datasets.png)

    The report canvas is blank. We see the **Filters**, **Visualizations**, and **Fields** panes on the right.

    ![Blank report canvas](media/service-get-started/power-bi-service-blank-report.png)

7. Notice there's an option for **Reading view** on the top nav pane. Because you have this option, that means you're currently in Editing view. A great way to get familiar with the report editor is to [take a tour](service-the-report-editor-take-a-tour.md).

    ![Reading view option](media/service-get-started/power-bi-service-reading-view.png)

    While in Editing view, you can create and modify your reports, because you're the *owner* of the report. That is, you're a *creator*. When you share your report with colleagues, they can only interact with the report in Reading view; your colleagues are *consumers*. Learn more about [Reading view and Editing view](consumer/end-user-reading-view.md).


## Step 2: Create a chart in a report
Now that you've connected to data, start exploring.  When you've found something interesting, you can create a dashboard to monitor it and see how it changes over time. Let's see how that works.
    
1. In the report editor, we start in the **Fields** pane on the right side of the page to build a visualization. Select the  **Gross Sales** and **Date** checkboxes.
   
   ![Fields list](media/service-get-started/power-bi-service-fields-pane-selected.png)

    Power BI analyzes the data and creates a visualization. If you selected **Date** first, you see a table. If you selected **Gross Sales** first, you see a column chart. 

2. Switch to a different way of displaying your data. Let's see this data as a line chart. Select the line chart icon from the **Visualizations** pane.
   
   ![Report editor with line chart selected](media/service-get-started/power-bi-service-select-line-chart.png)

3. This chart looks interesting, so let's *pin* it to a dashboard. Hover over the visualization and select the pin icon. When you pin this visualization, it's stored on your dashboard and kept up-to-date so you can track the latest value at a glance.
   
   ![Pin icon](media/service-get-started/power-bi-service-pin-visual.png)

4. Because this report is new, you're prompted to save it before you can pin a visualization to a dashboard. Give your report a name (for example, *Sales over time*), and then select **Save**. 

5. Select **New dashboard** and name it *Financial sample for tutorial*. 
   
   ![Name the report](media/service-get-started/power-bi-pin.png)
   
6. Select **Pin**.
   
    A success message (near the top-right corner) lets you know the visualization was added as a tile to your dashboard.
   
    ![Pinned to dashboard dialog](media/service-get-started/power-bi-pin-success.png)

7. Select **Go to dashboard** to see your new dashboard with the line chart that you pinned to it as a tile. 
   
   ![Dashboard with visualization pinned](media/service-get-started/power-bi-service-dashboard-tile.png)
   
8. Select the new tile on your dashboard to return to the report. Power BI returns you to the report in Reading view. 

1. To switch back to Editing view, select **More options** (...) in the top nav pane > **Edit**. Back in Editing view, you can continue to explore and pin tiles.

    ![Select Edit to edit the report](media/service-get-started/power-bi-service-edit-report.png)

## Step 3: Explore with Q&A

For a quick exploration of your data, try asking a question in the Q&A question box. Q&A creates natural-language queries about your data. In a dashboard, the Q&A box is at the top (**Ask a question about your data**). In a report, it's in the top nav pane (**Ask a question**).

1. To go back to the dashboard, select **My workspace** in the black **Power BI** bar.

    ![Go back to My workspace](media/service-get-started/power-bi-service-go-my-workspace.png)

1. On the **Dashboards** tab, select your dashboard.

    ![Select your dashboard](media/service-get-started/power-bi-service-dashboard-tab.png)

1. Select **Ask a question about your data**. Q&A automatically offers a number of suggestions.

    ![Q&A canvas](media/service-get-started/power-bi-service-new-qanda.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you don't see the suggestions, turn on **New Q&A experience**.

2. Some of the suggestions return a single value. For example, select **maximum sale**.

    Q&A searches for an answer and presents it in the form of a *card* visualization.

    ![Maximum sale card](media/service-get-started/power-bi-service-qanda-maximum-sale.png)

3. Select the pin icon ![Pin icon](media/service-get-started/pbi_pinicon.png) to show this visualization on the Financial sample for tutorial dashboard.

1. Scroll down in the **Questions to get you started** list and select **average cog for each month**. 

    ![Average COG for each month](media/service-get-started/power-bi-service-qanda-average-cog.png)

1. Pin the bar chart to the **Financial Sample for tutorial** dashboard, too.

1. Place the cursor after *by month* in the Q&A box and type *as line*. Select **line (Visualization Type)**. 

    ![Chart as line visualization](media/service-get-started/power-bi-service-qanda-as-line.png)

4. Select **Exit Q&A** to return to your dashboard, where you see the new tiles you created. 

   ![Dashboard with chart pinned](media/service-get-started/power-bi-service-dashboard-qna.png)

   You see that even though you changed the chart to a line chart, the tile remained a bar chart because that's what it was when you pinned it. 

## Step 4: Reposition tiles

The dashboard is wide. We can rearrange the tiles to make better use of the dashboard space.

1. Drag the lower-right corner of the *Gross Sales* line chart tile upward, until it snaps at the same height as the Sales tile, then release it.

    ![Resize the tile](media/service-get-started/power-bi-service-resize-tile.png)

    Now the two tiles are the same height.

    ![Resized tile](media/service-get-started/power-bi-service-resized-tile.png)

1. Drag the *Average of COGS* bar chart tile until it fits under the *Gross Sales* line chart.

    That looks better.

    ![Rearranged dashboard](media/service-get-started/power-bi-service-rearranged-dashboard.png)

## Step 5: Interact with tiles

Here's one last interaction to observe, before you start making your own dashboards and reports. Selecting the different tiles delivers different results. 

1. First select the *Gross Sales* line chart tile you pinned from the report. 

    Power BI opens the report in Reading view. 

2. Select the browser back button. 

1. Now select the *Average of COGS* bar chart tile you created in Q&A. 

    Power BI doesn't open the report. Q&A opens instead, because you created this chart there.


## Clean up resources
Now that you've finished the tutorial, you can delete the dataset, report, and dashboard. 

1. In the nav pane, make sure you're in **My Workspace**.
2. Select the **Datasets** tab and locate the dataset you imported for this tutorial.  
3. Select **More options** (...) > **Delete**.

    ![Delete the dataset](media/service-get-started/power-bi-service-delete-dataset.png)

    When you delete the dataset, you see a warning that **All reports and dashboard tiles containing data from this dataset will also be deleted**.

4. Select **Delete**.

## Next steps

Make dashboards even better by adding more visualization tiles and [renaming, resizing, linking, and repositioning them](service-dashboard-edit-tile.md).
