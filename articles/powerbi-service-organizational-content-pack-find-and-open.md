# Find and open an organizational content pack  

When an organizational content pack is published to your organization or [group](powerbi-service-groups.md%0A), it appears in your  content gallery.  Browse the content gallery to find and open organizational content packs.

## Open an organizational content pack  
Every [Power BI Pro](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/pricing) user has an organizational content pack library that displays content packs shared with the entire organization. If you belong to any [groups](powerbi-service-groups.md%0A), you'll also see content packs shared with those groups.   

1.  From the left Navigation Pane, select **Get Data \> My Organization**.

    The library displays all content packs published to the entire organization and published to groups that you are a member of.

2.  Don't see the content pack you're looking for? Tap in the search box and type key words:  
	 ![](media/powerbi-service-organizational-content-pack-find-and-open/cp_searchbox.png)

3.  Select a content pack to reveal additional details. If there are many content packs in the library, use the Search box. 

4.  Select **Connect** to add the content pack to your active workspace. New reports and datasets are listed with a yellow asterisk.

The content pack is locked when you first connect to it, but you can [edit and save your own copy](powerbi-service-organizational-content-packs-use-and-work-with.md). 

## Changes to the content pack  
If the content pack owner changes the content pack, and:  
- You haven't customized the content pack, the update is automatically applied.

- You have customized the content pack: you receive a notification that there is a new version. You can go to the content pack library and get the updated content pack without losing your personalized copy. Now you'll have two copy: your personalized copy and the updated content pack.  In the personalized version, all tiles from the original content pack will be gone. Tiles pinned from other reports will still render.
