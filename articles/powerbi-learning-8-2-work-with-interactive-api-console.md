# Work With the Interactive API Console

*Watch and learn how to make API calls to your Power BI service account through the Power BI Dev Portal*

Let's look at how you can connect through the API to push data programmatically into Power BI from your own applications.

The [Power BI dev portal](http://dev.powerbi.com "Power BI Dev Portal") has a number of resources that will help you get started, from sample applications to documentation about the API. You can also select **Get started now** from this page to try out the interactive API. In the navigation bar on the left-hand side of the screen you can find links to different core APIs.

Select a specific API call to open a detail pane which contains information such as the call URL, the syntax for your request, and some expected responses. You can also select the **Try** button from this pane to interactively call this API. (If you haven't already signed in to Power BI, you will be asked to authenticate first.) When you select **Call Resource**, the call will be completed with the data associated with your Power BI service account.

You can use the Dev Portal to try a variety of calls, such as listing and creating datasets, and adding rows to a table. Any changes made through the Dev Portal will be reflected immediately in the Power BI service.
