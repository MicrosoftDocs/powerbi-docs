# What's new in the mobile apps for Power BI  
[← Mobile apps for Power BI](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/topics/72969-mobile-apps-for-power-bi)

## September 2015  
Improvements in the Power BI mobile apps -- Android, iOS (iPhone and iPad), and Windows.

### Android  
-   Support for group workspaces: Collaborate with colleagues in group workspaces. 

-   Support for non-authenticated users:  For the few scenarios when users fail or can’t sign in to the app, we added a fast, convenient way to contact support and send feedback.

-   Improved user experience when accessing dashboards using role-based security.          

-   Improved data formatting of charts and alignment of all dashboard tiles. 

### iOS (iPhone and iPad)  
-   New & improved navigation: New drawer navigation maximizes screen real estate and improves navigation throughout the app. 

-   Group workspaces: Collaborate with colleagues in group workspaces. 

-   Authentication process upgrade Quality, performance, and functionality improvements enhance the app authentication process, including support for SSO (Single Sign-On). 

-   Improved data representation of line chart tiles to better compress the x-axis.

-   Improved user experience when using with role-based security.

-   Touch-optimized improvements for matrix chart tiles: Now you can easily scroll through your matrix data and view all its data easily and intuitively.

-   Improved data formatting of charts and alignments of dashboard tiles. 

-   Removal of iOS 7 support: To maintain highest security standards for Power BI, we will no longer support iOS 7 installed devices. iOS 8 and above is required. 

-   Send feedback and rating added in app: Added in-app capability to send feedback and provide ratings so that we can increase the community’s influence on our roadmap and promote issues easily and directly from the app.

### Windows   
-   Improved map tile rendering in in-focus mode to maximize screen real estate.

-   Improved user experience when accessing dashboards using role-based security. 

-   A new capability allows you to browse back and forth through dashboard tiles exploring them directly in in-focus mode without the need to return to the dashboard to select the next tile.

-   Additional stability and performance improvements.
