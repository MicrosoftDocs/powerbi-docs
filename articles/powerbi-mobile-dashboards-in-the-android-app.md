# Dashboards in the Android app for Power BI  

Dashboards are a portal to your company's life cycle. Learn how you can view, explore, and share your dashboards in the Android phone app for Power BI.  

You don't create dashboards on your Android phone. You [create dashboards](powerbi-service-dashboards.md) or [connect to built-in dashboards for services](powerbi-content-packs-services.md) such as Salesforce in the Power BI service ([https://www.powerbi.com](https://www.powerbi.com)) on your computer.

Then in the [Android app for Microsoft Power BI](powerbi-mobile-android-app-get-started.md), you can explore these same dashboards. Dashboards refresh in real time, automatically, so you don't need to manually refresh them.

## View dashboards on your Android phone  
1.  Open the Power BI app on your Android phone and sign in.

    Need to [download the Android app](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=544867) first?

3.  Tap a dashboard to open it.

     -     Yellow stars ![](media/powerbi-mobile-dashboards-in-the-android-app//power-bi-mobile-yes-favorite-icon.png) show which dashboards are favorites. 

     -     A notation below a dashboard name ![](media/powerbi-mobile-dashboards-in-the-android-app/power-bi-android-dashboard-medium-classification.png) shows how the data in each dashboard is classified. Read more about [data classification in Power BI](powerbi-service-data-classification.md).


    Power BI dashboards look a little different on your Android phone. All the tiles appear the same width, and they're arranged one after another from top to bottom.

     Or just turn your phone sideways to [view them in landscape mode](#view-dashboards-in-landscape-mode) on your phone.

    >**Tip**: If you're the dashboard owner, in the Power BI service you can [create a view of the dashboard specifically for phones](powerbi-service-create-dashboard-phone-view.md) in portrait mode. 

5.  While on the dashboard, you can tap the vertical ellipsis (...) next to the name to invite a colleague, refresh, or get information about the dashboard:

6.  Swipe up and down to see all the [tiles in the dashboard](powerbi-mobile-tiles-in-the-android-app.md). 

6.  To go back to the dashboards home page, tap the dashboard name to open the breadcrumb trail, then tap **My Workspace**.   


## View dashboards in landscape mode
You can also view dashboards in landscape mode, just by turning your phone. The dashboard layout changes from a series of tiles to a view of the whole dashboard &#151; you see all of the dashboard’s tiles laid out as they are in the Power BI service.

You can use the “pinch” gesture to zoom in and out on different areas of your dashboard, pan to navigate it. And you can still [tap a tile](powerbi-mobile-tiles-in-the-android-app.md) to open the tile in focus mode and interact with your data.
