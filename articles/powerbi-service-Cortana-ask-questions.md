# Tips for using Power BI with Cortana

## Before you begin

In order to ask questions about your Power BI data, you'll need to [activate Cortana on Windows 10](powerbi-service-cortana-enable.md).  

In Power BI, you can work with datasets that you own or that have been shared with you. To access those same datasets in Cortana, a dataset owner must [enable each  dataset for Cortana](powerbi-service-cortana-enable.md).  

## Asking questions

Any Power BI user can use Cortana to ask questions about their Power BI datasets.  Dataset owners can [improve answers by creating Answer Pages in Power BI](powerbi-service-cortana-desktop-entity-cards.md).  

1. Using Cortana, ask or type a question.  For example, ask "how many new stores opened in March?"

2. Cortana looks for answers in the Power BI reports and datasets available to you, and displays them under the heading **Power BI** and marked with the Power BI icon.

3. Power BI first looks for answers in [Answer Pages]([powerbi-service-cortana-desktop-entity-cards.md]) and then searches your datasets and reports for other answers and displays them in the form of visualizations.  The highest-scoring results display first as *best matches*, followed by links to other possible answers and applications. Best matches come from Power BI Answer Pages or Power BI reports.

  >NOTE: If you speak your question, Cortana will only display **Power BI** answers if it finds a best match.  

4. To open an answer in Power BI, select the link.


## Other Tips

- Cortana will only search for answers in Power BI if the question has 2 or more words.

- If you add the word "my" to your question, Cortana searches available datasets for answers that contain information found in your Windows 10 profile (the information you see when you click on your picture).
