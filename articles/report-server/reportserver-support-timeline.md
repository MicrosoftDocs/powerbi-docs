# Support timeline for Power BI Report Server

Power BI Report Server will be released a few times per year. Security and critical updates will available until the next release becomes generally available (GA). After the next release, the previous release will continue to receive security updates for the remainder of the 12 month release lifespan.

This support policy allows us to deliver innovation to customers at a rapid rate while providing flexibility for customers to adopt the innovation at their pace.

* Security and Critical Updates servicing phase - When running the latest current version of Power BI Report Server, you will receive both Security and Critical updates.
* Security Updates (Only) servicing phase - After a new version is released, support for older versions will reduce to Security updates only for the remainder of the twelve (12) month support lifecycle (shown in figure 1).
