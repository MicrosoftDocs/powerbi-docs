By default, the email address you used to sign up to Power BI with is used to send you updates about activity in Power BI.  For example, when someone sends you a sharing invitation it will go to this address.

Sometimes you may want these emails delivered to an alternate email address rather than the one you originally used to sign up for Power BI with.

Here's how to do that:

1.  [Click here](https://portal.office.com/profile) to go to your Office 365 profile page.  If you are prompted to, sign in with the email address and password you use for Power BI.

2.  Scroll to the bottom of the profile page.  Click the edit link in the Contact details section.  If you do not see an Edit link, this means your email address is managed by your Office 365 administrator and you will need to contact them to update your email address.

3.  In the Alternate email field, enter the email address you would like Power BI updates to be sent to.

> [AZURE.NOTE] Changing this setting will not affect what email address is used to send service updates, newsletters, and other promotional communications.  Those will always be sent to the email address you originally used when registering for Power BI.
