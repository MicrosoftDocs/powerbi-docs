# An Introduction to using Power BI

[![Welcome to Power BI](./media/powerbi-learning-course0-article1/videothumb.jpg)]

Now that you know the basic of Power BI, let’s jump into some hands-on experiences and a guided tour. As Will explains all the things you can do with Power BI, keep in mind that all of these activities, and all the analysis you can do with Power BI, are based on those basic building blocks we covered in the previous topic.  

A common flow of activity in Power BI is the following:

-   Bring data into Power BI Desktop, and create a report.
-   Publish to the Power BI service, where you create new visualizations or build dashboards
-   Share your dashboards with others, especially people who are on the go
-   View and interact with shared dashboards and reports in Power BI Mobile apps

As mentioned earlier, you might spend all your time in the Power BI service, getting data and creating dashboards – that’s just fine. In order to help you understand the full continuum of Power BI and what it can do, we’ll show you all of it… then you can decide how to use it to your best advantage.

So let’s jump in, and let Will guide us through the experience.
