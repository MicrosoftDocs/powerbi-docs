# Delete a report from Power BI  

Don't worry, deleting a report does not delete the dataset that the report is based on.  And any visualizations that you pinned from the report are also safe -- they remain on the dashboard until you delete them individually.

## To delete a report:  
1.  In the left navigation pane, right-click the report to delete and select **Delete**.

2.  Confirm the deletion.

>**Note:**  
>If the report is part of a [content pack](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/651040), you will not be able to delete it using this method.  See [Deleting an organizational content pack](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/663661).
