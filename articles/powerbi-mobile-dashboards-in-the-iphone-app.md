# Dashboards in the iPhone app (Power BI for iOS)  

Dashboards are a portal to your company's life cycle and processes. A dashboard is an overview, a single place to monitor the current state of the business. 


Power BI comes with built-in dashboards for some data sources such as Salesforce, and you can create your own [dashboards in Power BI](powerbi-service-dashboards.md). Your colleagues can also share their dashboards with you.

In the iPhone app for Microsoft Power BI for iOS, you see and can interact with all of these dashboards.

## View dashboards on your iPhone  
1.  Open the Power BI app on your iPhone and sign in.

    Need to [download the iPad app](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=522062) from the Apple App Store?

2.  From the navigation pane, swipe right to see your dashboards.

3.  Tap a dashboard to open it.  

    Power BI dashboards look a little different on your iPhone. All the tiles appear the same size, and they're arranged one after another from top to bottom.

    >**NOTE**: You can also view dashboards horizontally, just by turning your phone. Read more about [landscape mode in the iPhone app](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/powerbi/archive/2015/11/02/enjoy-the-landscape-with-the-power-bi-iphone-app.aspx).
