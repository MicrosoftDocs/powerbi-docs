# Dashboards in the iPhone app (Power BI for iOS)  

Dashboards are a portal to your company's life cycle. Learn how you can view, explore, and share your dashboards in the Power BI for iOS  app on the iPhone.  

You don't create dashboards in the Power BI app on your iPhone. You [create dashboards](powerbi-service-dashboards.md) or [connect to built-in dashboards for services](powerbi-content-packs-services.md) such as Salesforce in the Power BI service ([https://www.powerbi.com](https://www.powerbi.com)) on your computer.

Then in the iPhone app for Microsoft Power BI for iOS, you can explore these same dashboards. Dashboards refresh in real time, automatically, so you don't need to manually refresh them.

## View dashboards on your iPhone  
1.  Open the Power BI app on your iPhone and sign in.

    Need to [download the iPhone app](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=522062) from the Apple App Store?

3.  Tap a dashboard to open it.

     -     The yellow stars ![](media/powerbi-mobile-dashboards-in-the-iphone-app/power-bi-mobile-yes-favorite-icon.png) show which dashboards are favorites. 

     -     The notation below each dashboard name ![](media/powerbi-mobile-dashboards-in-the-iphone-app/power-bi-dashboard-medium-classification.png) shows how the data in each dashboard is classified. Read more about [data classification in Power BI](powerbi-service-data-classification.md).

    By default, Power BI dashboards look a little different on your iPhone. All the tiles appear the same size, and they're arranged one after another from top to bottom.

    >**Tip**: If you're the dashboard owner, in the Power BI service you can [create a view of the dashboard specifically for phones](powerbi-service-create-dashboard-phone-view.md) in portrait mode. 

     Or just turn your phone sideways to [view the dashboard in landscape mode](#view-dashboards-in-landscape-mode) on your phone.

    -   [Tap a tile](powerbi-mobile-tiles-in-the-iphone-app.md) to open it in focus mode and interact with it.

    -   [Interact with a report page tile](powerbi-mobile-report-page-tiles-in-the-iphone-app.md) in the iPhone app.

    -   Tap the star ![](media/powerbi-mobile-dashboards-in-the-iphone-app/power-bi-mobile-not-favorite-icon.png) to [make it a favorite](powerbi-mobile-favorites.md).

    -  Tap **Invite** ![](media/powerbi-mobile-dashboards-in-the-iphone-app/pbi_ipad_shareiconblk.png) to [invite a colleague](powerbi-mobile-share-a-dashboard-from-the-iphone-app.md) to view your dashboard.

    -  [Sync the dashboard with your Apple Watch](powerbi-mobile-apple-watch.md).

## View dashboards in landscape mode

Just turn your phone sideways to view dashboards in landscape mode. The dashboard layout changes from a series of tiles to a view of the whole dashboard&#151;you see all of the dashboard’s tiles just as they are in the Power BI service.

You can use the “pinch” gesture to zoom in and out on different areas of your dashboard, pan to navigate it. And you can still [tap a tile](powerbi-mobile-tiles-in-the-win10phone-app.md) to open the tile in focus mode and interact with your data.
