# Dashboards in the iPhone app (Power BI for iOS)
[← iPhone app (Power BI for iOS)](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/topics/78002-iphone-app-power-bi-for-ios-preview)

Dashboards are a portal to your company's life cycle and processes. A dashboard is an overview, a single place to monitor the current state of the business.

Power BI comes with built-in dashboards for some data sources such as Salesforce, and you can create your own [dashboards in Power BI](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/424868-dashboards-in-power-bi-preview). Your colleagues can also share their dashboards with you.

In the iPhone app for Microsoft Power BI for iOS, you see and can interact with these same dashboards.
