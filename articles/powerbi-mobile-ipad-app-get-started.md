# Get started with the iPad app (Power BI for iOS)  

The iPad app for Microsoft Power BI for iOS is part of the mobile BI experience for Power BI and Reporting Services. With live, touch-enabled mobile access to your important business information on premises and in the cloud, you can view and interact with your company dashboards and reports easily, from anywhere. Explore the data in dashboards, and share them with your colleagues in email or text messages.

Maybe a colleague sent you a link to a Power BI dashboard? Now you can view it on your iPad.

You can [create dashboards and reports in the Power BI service](powerbi-service-get-started.md) with your own data. Then interact with your dashboards and reports, explore the data, and share them, all from the iPad app for Power BI.

You can also [view SQL Server KPIs and mobile reports for your on-premises data](powerbi-mobile-ipad-kpis-mobile-reports.md) in the iPad app for Power BI. You [create those KPIs and mobile reports with the SQL Server Mobile Report Publisher](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt652547.aspx).

Find out [what's new in the Power Bi mobile apps](powerbi-mobile-whats-new-in-the-mobile-apps.md).

>**Note**: You need a SQL Server 2016 CTP 3.2 Reporting Services web portal where you can publish your mobile reports and KPIs.

    >Tip: When you're in the app, tap the options icon ![](media/powerbi-mobile-ipad-app-get-started/PBI_iPad_OptionsIcon.png) in the upper-left corner to go between the two. 

## Try the Power BI samples
