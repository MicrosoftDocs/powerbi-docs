# Free trial for Power BI Pro

Power BI Pro has all the features of the free version of Power BI, and additional collaboration and data refresh features. It also has higher data capacity and data streaming limits. For more information, see [Power BI Pricing](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/pricing). To try a 60-day free trial of Power BI Pro, sign into Power BI, and try one of these Power BI Pro features:

-   Create and publish customized [content packs](powerbi-service-organizational-content-packs-introduction.md)
-   Share [refreshable](powerbi-refresh-data.md) team dashboards and reports using [groups](powerbi-service-groups.md)
-   Connect to on-premises data using [Personal Gateway](powerbi-personal-gateway.md)
-   Enable live interactive connectivity to the following sources:
	-   [SQL Server Analysis Services](powerbi-sql-server-analysis-services-tabular-data.md)
	-   [Spark on Azure HDInsight](powerbi-spark-on-hdinsight-with-direct-connect.md)
	-   [Azure SQL Data Warehouse](powerbi-azure-sql-data-warehouse-with-direct-connect.md)
	-   [Azure SQL Database](powerbi-azure-sql-database-with-direct-connect.md)

When you try any of these features, you will be prompted to start your free trial.

**Notes**

-   If you need more time to evaluate Power BI, you can request to extend your trial period for 60 more days.
-   Users taking advantage of this in-product Power BI Pro trial do not appear in the Office 365 admin portal as Power BI Pro Trial users (they appear as Power BI free users). They will, however, show up as Power BI Pro Trial users in the **manage storage** page in Power BI.
-   If you are an IT Administrator wishing to acquire and deploy Power BI trial licenses to multiple users in your organization without having individual users accept trial terms individually, you can sign up for a [Power BI Pro subscription trial](https://portal.office.com/Signup/MainSignup15.aspx?OfferId=d59682f3-3e3b-4686-9c00-7c7c1c736085&dl=POWER_BI_PRO).  You will need to be an Office 365 Global or Billing Admin or create a new tenant to sign up for an admin trial.
