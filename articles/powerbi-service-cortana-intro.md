# Introduction to Cortana for Power BI

Ask natural language questions in Cortana and find answers from data stored in Power BI.

## How do Cortana and Power BI work together?

With the November 2015 update of Windows 10, Cortana can now find answers from data stored in Power BI through the Public Preview of integration between Cortana and Power BI. To use Cortana to get answers from Power BI, all that is required is to add the work or school account you use with Power BI to Windows 10 and have access to a dataset in Power BI that is enabled for Cortana.

Similar to Power BI Q&A, ask or type your questions using natural language. Cortana will search your Cortana-enabled datasets in Power BI for answers and display results directly in your Windows 10 device.   

Cortana can find answers either directly from datasets in Power BI or from report pages published to Power BI and designed specifically for Cortana (called *Answer Pages*).  Interact with the visualizations as you would in Power BI or, to further explore an answer, simply open a result in Power BI.

Cortana ranks the answers from Power BI, giving you one or more best matches if there is high confidence a result is a good answer. Other potential answers from Power BI are listed in a Power BI section below any best matches. If you're a dataset owner, you can help Cortana return better answers by creating specialized reports (called *Answer Pages*) for Cortana in Power BI Desktop to answer the most-common questions and by optimizing your model for Power BI Q&A.

## How do I get results?

When a Windows 10 (version 1511 or higher) user adds the account he or she uses with Power BI to Windows 10 in Windows 10 **Settings > Accounts**, Cortana automatically checks to see if any data is available in Power BI. Cortana then checks Power BI for answers to searches, and if any are found, it offers them as results.

## How do I get started?

- Cortana looks for answers in Power BI datasets that you have access to. If you are a dataset owner, [enable Cortana to access the dataset (and its reports)](powerbi-service-cortana-enable.md).  

- Answers from Power BI in Cortana need to be [enabled in Windows 10](powerbi-service-cortana-enable.md).

- If you are a dataset owner, [create Answer Pages designed specifically for Cortana](powerbi-service-cortana-desktop-entity-cards.md).
