# Create featured questions for Power BI Q&A  

If you own a dataset, you can add your own featured questions to that dataset.  And Power BI Q&A will show those questions to colleagues who use your dataset.  Featured questions give your colleagues ideas about the types of questions they can ask about the dataset. The featured questions you add are up to you -- add popular questions, questions that display interesting results, or questions that may be hard to phrase.

This article uses the Retail Analysis Sales sample.

1.  Select the Q&A question box.   Notice that Q&A is already being helpful by displaying a list of terms that appear in the dataset.

2.  To add to this list, select the gear icon in the top right corner of Power BI.
