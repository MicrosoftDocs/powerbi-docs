# About filters and highlighting in Power BI reports

Power BI reports provides several ways to filter and highlight data. Because of the metadata in the underlying [data model](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-a-Data-Model-in-Excel-87e7a54c-87dc-488e-9410-5c75dbcb0f7b?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US), Power BI uses the relationships between the different tables and fields in the model to make items on a report page highlight and filter each other.

***Filters*** remove all but the data you want to focus on.  ***Highlighting*** is not filtering since it does not remove data but instead highlights a subset of the visible data; the unhighlighted data remains visible but dimmed.

Filters can be applied to individual visualizations, to report pages, and to an entire report. 

>**TIP**: You must be in [Editing View](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/443094-edit-a-report%0A) to add new filters to a report or to create filters that remain with the report.  In [Reading View](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/445094-interact-with-a-report-in-reading-view%0A), you (and people you've shared the report with) can interact with those filters but cannot save changes made to those filters.
