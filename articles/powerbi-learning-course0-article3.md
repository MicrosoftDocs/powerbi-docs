*Learn how to connect to a cloud service and create an out-of-the-box dashboard in minutes*

A core part of Power BI is its ability to connect to cloud and SaaS applications and quickly create out-of-the-box dashboards that highlight key metrics.

From within the Power BI service, select **Get Data**, and then select the service to which you want to connect. (There are currently over 59 services available, and we are always adding more!) You will be prompted to sign in with your service credentials. Once Power BI has imported your information, you'll have a new dashboard that displays your service data in insightful ways, including KPIs and historical visualizations.

To see more of the underlying data behind a visualization, simply click on it in the dashboard and you'll be taken to the associated report. You can also ask questions of your data using natural language. For example, type "How many issues were closed" in the questions field, and Power BI will answer you with an appropriate visualization. You can pin the answer to popular questions to your dashboard to save time in the future.

A good dashboard needs to be kept up to date! Use the service entry under Datasets to **Schedule Refresh** and automatically update your data on reliable schedule.
