# Get Power BI data from the real world with the mobile apps

Power BI mobile apps can connect the real world directly to related BI information, in a number of different ways. 

## QR codes for tiles
Create a QR code for a tile in a dashboard, and put the QR code anywhere you want. When your colleagues scan the code with their iPhones or Android phones, they see the tile you've associated with that QR code &#151; on an iPhone, they see the tile in augmented reality. (One metric, Manufacturing scenarios, presentation)

## QR codes for reports
Create a QR code for a report.  When your colleagues scan the code with their iPhones (Android phones coming soon), they see the report you've associated with that QR code. (More data, analyze, explore)
