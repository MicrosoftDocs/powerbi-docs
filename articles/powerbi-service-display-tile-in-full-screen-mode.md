# Display a dashboard tile in full screen mode

Tiles must first be [popped out](powerbi-service-display-dash-in-focus-mode.md) before they can be displayed in full screen mode.

## What is Full Screen Mode?

Display your [dashboards, reports](powerbi-service-dash-and-reports-fullscreen.md), and tiles without the distraction of menus and navigation buttons.  You get an unadulterated, full view of your business at a glance, all the time. This is sometimes referred to as TV Mode.

Some uses for full screen mode are:

- presenting your tile at a meeting or conference
- displaying your tile in an office on a dedicated large screen or projector
- looking at your tile on a small screen
- reviewing your tile in locked mode -- you can touch the screen or mouse over the tile without opening the underlying report


## To turn full screen mode on (and off)

1. [Pop out the tile and display it in Focus mode](powerbi-service-display-dash-in-focus-mode.md).

    Your tile fills the report canvas.

3. From the top menubar, select this icon    ![](media/powerbi-service-display-tile-in-full-screen-mode/powerbi-full-screen-icon.png) to display the tile in Full Screen mode.

4.  In full screen mode, the tile fills your entire screen.
