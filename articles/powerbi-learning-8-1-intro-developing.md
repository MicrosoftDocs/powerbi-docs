# Introduction to Developing with Power BI

*Get introduced to the ways developers can enrich their applications with Power BI*

If you're a developer, you can use Power BI to enhance and enrich your applications. You can take data from applications and push it into Power BI programmatically, and you can take visualizations from Power BI and integrate them into your work. You can even write custom visualizations to ensure that you're showing off your data insights in the best format.

There are a variety of APIs and programmatic ways to interact with Power BI that add value to your own applications.
