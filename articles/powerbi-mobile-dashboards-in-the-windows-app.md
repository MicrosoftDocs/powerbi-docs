# Dashboards in the Power BI for Windows app

[← Power BI app for Windows](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/topics/75729-power-bi-app-for-windows)

Dashboards are a portal to your company's life cycle and processes. A dashboard is an overview, a single place to monitor the current state of the business.

Microsoft Power BI comes with built-in dashboards for some data sources such as Salesforce, and you create your own [dashboards in Power BI](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/424868-dashboards-in-power-bi).

Then you see those same dashboards in the Power BI for Windows app, and you can see dashboards your colleagues share with you.
