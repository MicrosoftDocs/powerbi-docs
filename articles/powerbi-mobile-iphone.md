#Get started with the iPad app (Power BI for iOS)

[← iPad app (Power BI for iOS)](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/topics/77999-ipad-app-power-bi-for-ios-preview)

The iPad app for Microsoft Power BI for iOS brings the mobile BI experience to Power BI. With live, touch-enabled mobile access to your important business information, you can view and interact with your company dashboards and reports easily, from anywhere. Explore the data in your dashboards, and share them with your colleagues in email or text messages.

Maybe a colleague sent you a link to a dashboard? Now you can view it on your iPad.

Or bring your own data together and create [dashboards and reports in Power BI](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/430814-get-started-with-power-bi). Then interact with your dashboards and reports, explore the data in them, and share snapshots with the iPad app for Power BI.
