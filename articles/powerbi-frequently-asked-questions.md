# Frequently asked questions

## What is Microsoft Power BI?

[Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) is a cloud-based business analytics service that enables anyone to visualize and analyze data with greater speed, efficiency, and understanding. It connects users to a broad range of data through easy-to-use dashboards, interactive reports, and compelling visualizations that bring data to life.

## What’s the difference between Power BI and Power BI Pro?

Power BI provides all sorts of features to help you get started exploring data in a whole new way. Power BI Pro provides all of the same great features in Power BI, plus additional features like more storage capacity, hourly scheduled refresh, live data sources with full interactivity, groups, and more. Learn more about [the differences between Power BI Pro and the free Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/pricing).

## How much does Power BI cost?

Power BI and Power BI Desktop are free. There is a 60-day free trial available for Power BI Pro. After that, Power BI Pro is $9.99/User/Month. Learn more about our pricing [Power BI pricing](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/pricing).

## What is Power BI Desktop?

[Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/designer) is a free desktop application you can install right on your own computer. Power BI Desktop works cohesively with the Power BI service by providing advanced data exploration, shaping, modeling, and report creation with highly interactive visualizations. You can save your work to a file, and publish your data and reports right to your Power BI site to share with others.

## What do I need to use Power BI?

Just a Web browser and work email address.

**Note:** Work email addresses ending in .gov aren’t currently supported.

## Does Power BI support mobile devices?

Yes. Power BI has native apps for Android, iOS, and Windows. Download one of the [Power BI mobile apps](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/mobile) from its respective store: [App Store](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=526218), [Google Play](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=544867&clcid=0x409), and [Windows Store](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=526478).

## Why do I have to sign up with my work email?

Power BI does not support email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunications providers. Learn more about [the Power BI self-service sign-up process](powerbi-service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi.md).

## Is Power BI available on-premises?

No, Power BI is not available as a private, internal cloud service. However, with Power BI and Power BI Desktop, you can securely connect to your own on-premises data sources. With the [Power BI Analysis Services Connector](powerbi-analysis-services-connector.md), you can connect live to your on-premises SQL Server Analysis Services Tabular models. And, with the [Power BI Personal Gateway](powerbi-personal-gateway.md), you can refresh data from other on-premises data sources.

## What data sources can I connect to?

The list of data sources for Power BI is extensive, but it can be grouped into the following:

- Data from [Excel and Power BI Desktop files](powerbi-service-get-data-from-files.md).

- Content packs with ready-made dashboards, reports, and datasets for services such as Salesforce. Connecting to these services requires an existing subscription for that service. In addition to establishing a data connection, Power BI provides pre-built dashboards and reports for each of these services.

- Connectors to databases and other datasets such as [Azure SQL Database](powerbi-azure-sql-database-with-direct-connect.md) and SQL Server [Analysis Services](powerbi-sql-server-analysis-services-tabular-data.md) tabular data.

## What are content packs?

Content packs are pre-built solutions for popular services as part of the Power BI experience. A subscriber to a supported service can quickly connect to their account from Power BI and see their data through live dashboards and interactive reports that have been pre-built for them.  We’ve released content packs for popular services such as Salesforce.com, Marketo, Adobe Analytics, Azure Mobile Engagement,  CircuitID, comScore Digital Analytix, Quickbooks Online, SQL Sentry, and tyGraph. Over the coming months, we’ll extend this to include content packs and integrations for Sage, SpaceCurve, Sumo Logic, Zuora, Planview, Insightly, Troux, Inkling, and others.

Organizational content packs provide users, BI professionals, and system integrators the tools to build their own content packs to share purpose-built dashboards, reports, and datasets within their organization.
