# Share a tile from the Windows 10 phone app for Power BI

When you share a snapshot of a tile from the [Windows 10 phone app for Microsoft Power BI](powerbi-mobile-win10phone-app-get-started.md), your recipients see the snapshot of the tile exactly as it was when you sent the mail. They can't open the dashboard. You can send snapshots of tiles to anyone — not just colleagues in the same email domain.

1. Open a [dashboard in the Windows 10 phone app](powerbi-mobile-dashboards-in-the-win10phone-app.md) for Power BI.

	Need to [download the Windows 10 phone app](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=544867) first?

2. Tap a tile to open it in focus mode.

3. Tap the share icon ![](media/powerbi-mobile-share-a-tile-from-the-win10phone-app/PBI_Win10Ph_ShareIcon.png) in the bottom-right corner of the tile.

5. Share the tile using any sharing app you have on your Windows 10 phone.
