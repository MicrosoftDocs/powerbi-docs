# Share a dashboard from the Power BI mobile app for Android tablets

Invite colleagues to view your dashboards by sharing links from the [Android app for Microsoft Power BI](powerbi-mobile-android-tablet-app-get-started.md). 

## Share a dashboard

1.  On the dashboards home page, tap the ellipsis (...) and tap **Invite a colleague**.

2.  Or, in the upper-right corner of a dashboard, tap the invite icon ![](media/powerbi-mobile-share-a-dashboard-from-the-android-tablet-app/power-bi-android-invite-icon.png).

 
    If you're the owner of the dashboard, you see the list of colleagues with whom you've shared this dashboard, with these notes:

    -   **Can view**: They have viewed the dashboard but can't share it.

    -   **Can view & invite**: They have viewed the dashboard and can share it with other colleagues.

2.  Type email addresses, and a message to accompany your dashboard invitation. Otherwise Power BI sends a default message.

3.  To allow resharing, leave **Allow recipients to share this dashboard** selected.

    >**Note**:  Resharing allows your coworkers to forward the email invitation to others in your organization, either through the browser or the mobile apps.

4.  Tap the airplane icon ![](media/powerbi-mobile-share-a-dashboard-from-the-android-tablet-app/PBI_Andr_SendPlane.png) in the upper-right corner to send the mail.

    Your colleagues get an email invitation with a direct link to the dashboard. The invitation expires after one month. When they open it in a browser or in one of the mobile apps, it's added to their Power BI account.

    >**Note**: Read more [notes about sharing dashboards with colleagues](powerbi-service-share-unshare-dashboard.md#notes-about-sharing).

## Unshare a dashboard

Only the dashboard owner can unshare a dashboard.

1.  In the upper-right corner of your dashboard, tap the invite icon ![](media/powerbi-mobile-share-a-dashboard-from-the-android-tablet-app/power-bi-android-invite-icon.png). 

    You see the list of colleagues with whom you've shared this dashboard.

2.   To stop sharing the dashboard with a colleague, tap the **X** next to a name \> **Remove**.
