# Migrating to the new Power BI experience

We are making [product and licensing updates to Power BI](https://www.microsoft.com/powerBI/licensing.aspx) that will lead to the deprecation of existing Power BI for Office 365 experiences by December 31, 2015. If you’re an existing Power BI for Office 365 customer, don’t worry: You will still be able to use your existing Power BI for Office 365 licenses as Power BI Pro licenses for the new experience.

Read [Migrating from Power BI for Office 365 to Power BI Pro](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=619089) to learn how to migrate from your existing Power BI for Office 365 experience to the new Power BI experience.  

This table compares key aspects of the two experiences.
