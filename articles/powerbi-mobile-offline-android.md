# View your data offline in the Power BI mobile apps

One advantage of viewing Power BI in a mobile app rather than in a mobile browser is that you can see your data even when you're not connected to a network. By default, Power BI refreshes the data frequently so you get up-to-date answers to your business questions any time, even while commuting or roaming.

## Data access while you're offline

While you're offline, you can access and interact with dashboards you've accessed previously from the mobile app.

You also have read-only access to any Power BI reports you've accessed previously from the mobile app. You can see the full report, but not filter, cross-filter, sort, or use slicers on it.

Background refresh updates your favorite dashboards, plus dashboards and reports you've viewed in the last two weeks. If you're connected to wi-fi, background refresh updates every 2 hours. Otherwise, if you’re on a 3G network, Power BI updates the content every 24 hours.

You can turn off scheduled refresh, for example to avoid network usage. Check the settings on your device.

## Offline indicators

Power BI provides clear indicators when you go in and out of offline mode, as well as indicators for missing dashboards, reports, and tiles that aren't available offline.

## Limitations
When you're offline with Power BI on your mobile device, you may encounter these limitations:

-   Power BI can cache up to 250 MB of data offline.
-   Some tile types require an active server connection, so they aren't available offline &#151; for example, Bing map tiles and some custom tiles.
-   Whole Excel workbooks in Power BI aren't available offline.
-   You can see Reporting Services mobile reports and KPIs offline, if you have viewed them while connected. They don't refresh in the background. They refresh every time you open them.
