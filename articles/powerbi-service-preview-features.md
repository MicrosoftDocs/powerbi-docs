# Opt-in for Power BI preview features
## What are *preview features*?

As we make improvements to Power BI, we'll release some new functionality as *preview features*. Preview features can be turned on and off, giving you the opportunity to try them out.

>[AZURE.IMPORTANT] At the current time, [the only preview feature available is the **new navigation**](powerbi-service-new-switch-navigation-experience.md).

##    Current previews available
**Navigation preview**: Starting in November 2016, we're previewing a [new Power BI navigation experience](powerbi-service-new-switch-navigation-experience.md). You'll be able to try it out for yourself, switching back and forth between the two experiences.

##  Turn a preview feature on (and off)

1.  Open your Settings menu by selecting the gear icon in the top right corner of your Power BI screen and choosing **Settings**.
