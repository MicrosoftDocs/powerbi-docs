**Update 8/17**: The Mandrill content pack has been restored in Power BI, we apologize for any inconvenience. We are always interested in your feedback, please contact us at http://support.powerbi.com.

Use Mandrill's analytics to quickly gain insights into your newsletter or marketing campaign. The data is set to refresh daily ensuring the data you're monitoring is up to date.
