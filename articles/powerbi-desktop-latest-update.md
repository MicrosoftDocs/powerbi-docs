# What's new in the latest Power BI Desktop update?

## June 2016 Update (2.36.4434.362)

You can now [download the latest version of Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop).

June has a shining collection of new and interesting updates for Power BI Desktop.

With this month's updates, we're adding video links beside new updates that are featured in the video blog. When you select that **[video]** link beside a new feature, the video opens in a new browser tab and plays from the time when the feature is being discussed. We hope you find the video links useful and helpful.

If an accompanying article describes the new feature in detail, you see an **[article]** link, which will take you to the article. Some new features have additional written information included in the blog post, but don't have their own article - for those, you can read a quick excerpt about the feature by selecting the **[blog]** link.

Lastly, some features are self-explanatory, and don't have a separate article or video segment.

Of course you can also watch the **Latest Updates** video from the beginning, right inside this article, by clicking on the **play** icon on the video image below.
