# Pin a Power BI tile or dashboard to the Start screen from the Power BI mobile app

You can pin Power BI tiles and dashboards to the Windows Start screen from the Power BI mobile app as *live tiles*, so you see all your critical metrics at a glance. When you add multiple tiles from the same dashboard, they're added to a single tile on the Start screen. When you tap the tile on the Start screen, the tile or dashboard opens in the Power BI mobile app for Windows 10.
