# Tiles in the Power BI mobile app for Windows 10  

Tiles are live snapshots of your data, displayed on a dashboard. Their values change as the data changes. You create tiles on your dashboards in the [Power BI](http://powerbi.com/) service. Then you see and interact with the tiles in your [Power BI mobile app for Windows 10](powerbi-mobile-win10phone-app-get-started.md).

1.  Open a [dashboard in the Power BI mobile app](powerbi-mobile-dashboards-in-the-win10phone-app.md) for Windows 10.

    Need to [download the app](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=526478) first?

2.  Tap a tile. It opens in focus mode, where it's easier to view and explore the tile data. In this mode you can:

     Tap the chart to move the bar in a line, bar, column, or bubble chart, to view the values for a specific point in the visualization.  

     In this line chart, the values of the black and teal lines are listed under the month, August, where the vertical bar intersects them.

      Spin a pie chart to show the values of the slice at the top of the pie.

      Tap the Share Snapshot icon ![](media/powerbi-mobile-tiles-in-the-win10phone-app/PBI_Win10Ph_ShareIcon.png) to [share a tile](powerbi-mobile-share-a-tile-from-the-win10phone-app.md) with others.   

      Tap the Open Report icon ![](media/powerbi-mobile-tiles-in-the-win10phone-app/PBI_Win10app_OpenRptIcon.png) to view the report that the tile is based on. 

     >**Note**: You can't open reports on a Windows 10 phone, so you don't see the Open Report icon there.

3.   Tap the back arrow or the back button to close the tile and return to the dashboard.
