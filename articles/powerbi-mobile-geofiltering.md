# Filter a report by location in the Power BI mobile apps for iOS

When you look at a Power BI report on your iPad, iPhone, or iPod Touch, do you see a little pushpin icon in the upper-right corner? If so, then you can filter that report based on your geographic location.

>**Note**: You can only filter by location if the geographic names in the report are in English &#150; for example, "New York City" or "Germany".

## Filter your report by your location

1. Open a report in the Power BI mobile app on your iOS device.

3. Tap the push pin ![](media/powerbi-mobile-geofiltering/power-bi-geofilter-icon.png) in the upper-right corner. You can filter on either city, state/province, or country/region, depending on how the report creator set up the report. The filter only lists options that match your current location.

## Why do only some reports have location tags?
When you or your colleagues create reports in Power BI Desktop, you can categorize geographical data for a column. Then, when you view that report in the Power BI mobile app for iOS, Power BI automatically provides geographical filters that match where you are.
