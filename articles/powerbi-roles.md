You can also [import Excel workbooks](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=544781) from OneDrive or your computer.

### Work with your organization

## Business Analyst
### Import, reshape, and model your data
With [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop), you can create your own reports based on [data from a wide variety of sources](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616301). Import data from on-premises sources such as SQL Server, SharePoint files and lists, Analysis Services, and other enterprise data solutions, or SaaS sources like Dynamics CRM, Salesforce, and Google Analytics. Reshape and model this data easily with the Power BI Desktop, to meet your analysis and reporting needs.

### Create stunning reports and visualizations
Power BI Desktop provides a seamless and powerful experience for creating and customizing your Power BI reports.

### Create content packs to share your insights
When you create dashboards and reports on data sources in Power BI, you can bundle them as _content packs_ and [publish them for your colleagues](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616303) as "out-of-the-box" solutions. Plus, you can schedule automatic data refreshes for the whole content pack.

## BI Professional
### Connect your on-premises Analysis Services Server
With Power BI, you can connect to your on-premises Analysis Services Tabular models using the [Analysis Services Connector](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616302). As the Analysis Services Server admin, you set up and maintain the Analysis Services Connector. Extending your on premise data investments to Power BI couldn't be easier with the Analysis Services Connector.

### Empower your colleagues to create their own reports
With the Analysis Services Connectors your colleagues can create dashboards and reports that query an on-premises Analysis Services model in real time.

## Developer
### Integrate your applications with Power BI
Power BI is the platform to use to add compelling data experiences to your solution, application, or service. With the Power BI REST API, you can build custom apps that leverage rich analytics in Power BI.

### Create real-time dashboards
Use the Power BI REST API to push data directly from your application into a dataset in Power BI. Using Azure Stream Analytics integration in Power BI, you can analyze high-volume, streaming data with live operational dashboards. Your dashboards will be updated in real time when the data changes. No more waiting or having to press the Refresh button.
