# Display Visuals and Tiles Full-Screen

*Learn how to get a full-screen view of select report visuals and dashboard tiles*

When you're looking at Power BI dashboards or reports in the service, it can sometimes be helpful to focus on an individual chart or visualization. You can do that in two different ways.

When you're on a dashboard, hover over a tile to see a few different icon options in the top right-hand corner. When you select the ellipses (the three dots) you see a collection of icons that represent actions you can take on the tile.

The left-most icon is labeled **Focus mode**. Select that icon to expand the tile to encompass the full dashboard space.

**Focus mode** allows you to see a lot more detail on your visuals and legends. For example, when you resize a tile in Power BI, some of the columns may not be shown because of the space available in the tile.

In **Focus mode**, you can see all the data. You can also pin the visual directly from Focus mode to a different dashboard by selecting the **Pin** icon. To exit **Focus mode**, select the **Back to...** icon in the top-left corner of **Focus mode**.

The process is similar when viewing a report. Hover over a visual to see the three icons in the top-right corner, and select the **Focus mode** icon. Selecting this expands your visualization to encompass the full report canvas. The visual is still interactive in this mode, although you temporarily lose any cross-filter effect between visualizations.

Hover over an expanded tile or report and select the **Back to...** left-caret icon in the top-left corner to return to the previous view.
