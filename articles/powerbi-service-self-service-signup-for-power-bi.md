# Self-service sign up for Power BI

Signing up for Power BI, as an individual, is easy! You can choose to use a free account, a Pro trial account, or purchase Power BI Pro, even if you are in an existing organization. Once you have determined which you would like to use, this article will walk you through the steps to get up and running.

> **Note:** If you are in an organization, individual sign up may be disabled. See [#individual-sign-up-has-been-turned-off] for more information if you get an error indicating it has been turned off.

## What email address can be used with Power BI?

Power BI requires that you use a work, or school, email address to sign up. Power BI does not support email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunication providers. This includes outlook.com, hotmail.com, gmail.com and others.

If you try to sign up with a personal email address, you will get a message indicating to use a work or school email address.

> **Note:** Government (.gov) and military (.mil) email addresses are not allowed at this time.

## Individual Sign up has been turned off

When trying to sign up for Power BI, you may encounter the following message.

    Your IT department has turned off signup for Microsoft Power BI.
 
![](media/powerbi-service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi/allowadhocsubscriptionfalse.png)

This could be because your organization has disabled individual sign ups. It could also be because you purchased Office 365 through a partner. [Learn more](powerbi-admin-syndication-partner).

If your organization has disabled individual sign ups, you will need to work with your IT group to get a Power BI license assigned to your account in order to continue.

## Troubleshooting

In many cases, registering for Power BI can be achieved by following the simple self-service signup process listed above. However, there are several reasons why you may not be able to complete self-service signup.  The table below summarizes some of the most common reasons you may not be able to complete signup and ways you can workaround these issues.

| **Symptom / Error Message** | **Cause and Workaround** |
|---|---|
| **Personal email addresses (e.g. nancy@gmail.com)** You receive a message like the following during signup: <br /><br /> *You entered a personal email address: Please enter your work email address so we can securely store your company's data.* <br /><br /> or <br /><br /> *That looks like a personal email address. Enter your work address so we can connect you with others in your company. And don’t worry. We won’t share your address with anyone.* | Power BI does not support email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunications providers. <br /><br /> To complete signup, try again using an email address assigned by your work or school. <br /><br /> If you still can't sign up and are willing to complete a more advanced setup process, you can [register for a new Office 365 trial subscription and use that email address to sign up](powerbi-admin-signing-up-for-power-bi-with-a-new-office-365-trial.md). |
