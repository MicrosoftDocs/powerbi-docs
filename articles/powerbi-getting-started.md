# Getting Started with Power BI

Microsoft Power BI helps you stay up to date with the information that matters to you.  With Power BI, **dashboards** help you keep a finger on the pulse of your business.  Your dashboards display **tiles** that you can click to explore further with **reports**.  Connect to multiple **datasets** to bring all of the relevant data together in one place.

Need help understanding the building blocks that make up Power BI Preview?  See [Power BI Preview - Basic Concepts]().
