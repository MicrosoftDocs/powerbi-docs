# Introduction to Cortana for Power BI

## How do Cortana and Power BI work together?

Ask natural language questions in Cortana and find answers from data stored in Power BI.

Similar to Power BI Q&A, ask or type your questions using natural language and Cortana will look in your Power BI-enabled datasets for answers and display them on your desktop or Windows 10 mobile device. You'll be able to interact with the visualizations as you would in Power BI -- drilling, filtering, highlighting, sharing, and much more.  

Answers can be Power BI report pages, or they can be automatically generated and presented as Power BI visualizations. To further explore an answer, simply open a result in Power BI.

Cortana ranks the answers, giving you one or more best matches followed by links to other answers or applications. If you're a dataset owner, you can help Cortana by creating specialized reports called *Answer Pages* to answer the most-common questions and present those answers as best matches in a format designed for display by Cortana.

## How do I get results?
When a Windows 10 (version 1511 or higher) user adds the account he or she uses with Power BI, Cortana automatically checks to see if any data is available in Power BI. Cortana then checks Power BI for answers to searches, and if any are found, it offers them as results.

## How do I get started?

- Cortana looks for answers in Power BI datasets that you have access to. If you are a dataset owner, [enable Cortana to access the dataset (and its reports)](powerbi-service-Cortana-enable.md).  

- Answers from Power BI in Cortana need to be [enabled in Windows 10](powerbi-service-Cortana-enable.md).

- If you are a dataset owner, [create Answer Cards designed specifically for Cortana](powerbi-service-Cortana-Desktop-entity-cards.md).
