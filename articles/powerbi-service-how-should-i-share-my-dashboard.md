# How should I share Power BI dashboards and reports?  

In Power BI you can share dashboards, reports, and tiles in several different ways. Each has its advantages. You can:

- Publish a report to the web.
- Share a dashboard with your colleagues and others.
- Create a dashboard in a group, then share it with colleagues outside the group.
- Create a content pack and publish it to your whole organization or to a security or distribution list.
- Share a snapshot of a tile from a Power BI mobile app.

In any case, your colleagues need to [sign up for Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) before they can see your dashboards.

Here's a summary of how sharing works, depending on which you do. Details follow below.

| Other people can        | When you: Share a dashboard | When you: Create a dashboard in a group | When you: Publish a content pack | When you: Publish to the web |
|:------------------------|:----------------------------|:----------------------------------------|:---------------------------------|:-----------------------------|
| View and interact       | yes                         | yes                                     | yes                              | yes                          |
| Edit the original       | no                          | yes                                     | no                               | no                           |
| Create their own copies | no                          | yes                                     | yes                              | no                           |
| Share with others       | colleagues, yes. others, no | yes                                     | no                               | no                           |

## Publish to the web

When you publish Power BI reports to the web, you can embed interactive visuals in blog posts, websites, social media, and other online communications, on any device. Publishing to web is available on reports in your personal workspace that you can edit. You can't publish to the web reports that were shared with you. More about [publishing to the web](powerbi-service-publish-to-web.md).

## Share a dashboard with colleagues and others 
When you share a dashboard, those you share it with can view it and interact with it, but can't edit it. They can see the same data that you see in the dashboard and reports. Your colleagues can share the dashboard with other colleagues, if you allow them to. Those outside your organization can view and interact with the dashboard, but can't share it. More about [sharing a dashboard](powerbi-service-share-unshare-dashboard.md).

## Create a dashboard in a group  
Groups in Power BI are built on Office 365 groups, so you and your colleagues need a Power BI Pro license. When you're a member of a group, you can create a dashboard in the group workspace. Everyone in the group can view, interact with, and edit the dashboard and its reports. They have the same permission you have. More about [groups in Power BI](powerbi-service-groups.md).

### Share a dashboard with colleagues outside the group  
If your group has dashboards, you can share them with colleagues outside the group. It works the same as [sharing a dashboard with colleagues](powerbi-service-share-unshare-dashboard.md).

## Create a content pack and publish it  
Content packs are a great way to share your Power BI insights with your colleagues. You create a dashboard with its reports and datasets, and then publish them all together as a content pack &#151; either for your whole organization or for those in a specific security group or distribution list. When those colleagues go to the Content Pack Library for your organization, they see your content pack along with any others they have permission to see. More about [organizational content packs](powerbi-service-organizational-content-packs-introduction.md).  

## Share a snapshot of a tile from a Power BI mobile app
When you share a tile from one of the Power BI mobile apps, you're sharing a snapshot of the tile. Your recipients see the tile exactly as it was when you sent the mail. They can't open the dashboard. You can send snapshots of tiles to anyone &#151; not just colleagues in the same email domain.

In some of the mobile apps, you can add annotations before you send the snapshot of the tile.

Share a snapshot of a tile from:

- The [iPad app (Power BI for iOS)](powerbi-mobile-annotate-and-share-a-snapshot-from-the-ipad-app.md)
- The [iPhone app (Power BI for iOS)](powerbi-mobile-annotate-and-share-a-tile-from-the-iphone-app.md)
- The [Power BI app for Android phones](powerbi-mobile-annotate-and-share-a-tile-from-the-android-app.md)
- The [Power BI app for Windows 10 devices](powerbi-mobile-annotate-and-share-a-snapshot-from-the-windows-app.md)
