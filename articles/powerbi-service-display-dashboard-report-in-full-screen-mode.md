# Display dashboards and reports in Full Screen mode  
[← Getting started](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/topics/63037-getting-started)

Display your dashboards and reports without the distraction of menus and navigation buttons.  You get an unadulterated, full view of your business at a glance, all the time. This is also referred to as TV mode.

Some uses for Full Screen mode are:  
-   presenting your dashboards and reports at a meeting or conference
-   displaying your dashboard in an office on a dedicated large screens or projectors
-   looking at your dashboards and reports on a small screen
-   reviewing your dashboards and reports in locked mode -- you can touch the screen or mouse over tiles without opening the underlying report

>**Note:**  
>*Tiles* can also be viewed in full screen mode (aka In-Focus mode).

## To turn Full Screen on (and off)  
1.  From your dashboard or report, select the **Full Screen** icon.
