# Congratulations - and what's next for you

You did it! **Congratulations!** You've completed the **Guided Learning** course for Power BI. You've come full circle from learning the basic elements of Power BI, taken a tour through its software features and elements, and learned how they all work together.

![](media/powerbi-learning-course0-article0/c0a0_2.png)

This is the last section (and the final topic) in the course, so if you went through all of these sections in order, take a moment to pat yourself on the back. Good job! You're now well versed in all these **important concepts**:

-   What [Power BI is](powerbi-learning-0-0-what-is-power-bi.md)
-   The [building blocks](powerbi-learning-0b-building-blocks-power-bi.md) of Power BI
-   [Getting](powerbi-learning-1-2-connect-to-data-sources-in-power-bi-desktop.md) and [modeling](powerbi-learning-2-1-intro-modeling-data.md) data
-   [Visualizations](powerbi-learning-3-1-intro-visualizations.md)
-   [Exploring data](powerbi-learning-4-0-intro-power-bi-service.md) in the Power BI service
-   Using [Excel and Power BI](powerbi-learning-5-1-intro-excel-data.md) together
-   And [publishing and sharing](powerbi-learning-6-0-intro-content-packs-groups.md) your work

That's a lot of knowledge, and now that you have all this in your head, you're ready to go put it to use! Here are some **links to downloads** or to get your browser **connected to the Power BI service**:

-   You can always [get the latest Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop)
-   Heading to the [Power BI service](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) is easy
-   Getting [mobile apps for Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/mobile/) is a tap away

There's more **help and reference** content available, too. Check out the following resources for more empowering information you can use:

-   [Power BI Desktop help content](powerbi-desktop-getting-started.md)
