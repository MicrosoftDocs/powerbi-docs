# Ask the right questions of Salesforce data in Power BI

[← Q&A in Power BI](https://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/topics/70394-q-a-in-power-bi)

In this article, we suggest the best questions to ask for [Salesforce data](http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/424863-salesforce-connector-for-power-bi) in Power BI, and how to go about asking your own questions.

For Salesforce, Power BI automatically generates a dashboard and a few reports when you connect. These dashboard tiles and report visualizations provide entities you can ask about. Let’s take a look at a report.

The visualizations in this report are:

-   Count of opportunity by name
-   Amount by Stage Name, and Name
-   Opportunities Closed
-   Opportunities Won

These are all great entities to start with when formulating your own questions. The key is to mix and match entities from what the visualization titles say. For example, from the list of visualizations, I can match amount with opportunities, so a potential question is "opportunities by amount". 

Also look at the values in a column. For example, Stage Name is the column, but has values such as “Prospecting”, “Qualification”, and “Needs Analysis”. So you can ask questions such as "count of opportunities for qualification". As you start playing around and asking your own questions, you’ll quickly learn which entities provide  visualizations that matter to you.
