# Collaborate with your Power BI group in Office 365

Probably the main reason you created a group in Power BI was to share and collaborate on dashboards, reports, and datasets in Power BI. Collaborating on data starts with connecting to files on your group’s OneDrive for Business. [Connect to your group’s files](powerbi-service-connect-to-files-on-your-groups-onedrive-for-business.md).

>**Note**: Groups are only available with [Power BI Pro](powerbi-power-bi-pro-content-what-is-it.md).

Collaboration doesn’t end with Power BI. Office 365 offers other group services, like sharing files on OneDrive for Business, conversations in Exchange, shared calendar and tasks, and so on.

Collaborating in Office 365 starts from the group’s workspace in Power BI.

1.  In Power BI, switch to the group’s workspace, so the group name is in the top-left corner.

2.  Select the ellipsis (**…**) next to your group name.
