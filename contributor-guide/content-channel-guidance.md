# Power BI technical content channel guidance

## aka: What goes where?

Generally speaking, core technical content for Microsoft Power BI belongs in the [Power BI Documentation Center](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/documentation). Members of the content and product teams also publish developer content to [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn877544.aspx), and we publish to the [Power BI blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/powerbi/).

The following channels are not part of the standard Power BI technical content experience:

* **TechNet Library**: TechNet does not offer a Power BI branded experience. All content for all audiences goes in the branded, scoped Power BI library hosted on MSDN.
* **TechNet Wiki**: The wiki does not offer a Power BI branded experience. The community and internal partners can contribute to Power BI technical content through the Discus comment stream and by contributing to articles through GitHub.
* **Standard MSDN library view**: Standard view does not offer a Power BI branded experience.
* **TechNet TechCenters**: Our center is published to https://powerbi.microsoft.com/developers.
* **MSDN DevCenters**: Our center is published to https://powerbi.microsoft.com/developers.
* **E-book, CSI e-book gallery**: Due to static nature of content, do not deliver content in e-book form. The vast majority of content should be published through powerbi.microsoft.com or to the Power BI scoped library.
