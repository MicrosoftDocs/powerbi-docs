# Power BI search page curation guidance
These days we need to think of Google (or other search engines, but mainly Google) as the home page for our content. The way our articles look in a list of search results is key to getting people to the right article, which is in turn key to making people happy with the articles they read. These guidelines are for optimizing the way our content looks in search results.

## pageTitle (Property)
This is the search result title.

* 39 maximum char + “ | Microsoft Power BI” (60 total char max, including spaces).
* Brand/site identifier is typed: space pipe space Microsoft Power BI
* Important keywords at the front.
* Opt.: Your title can be up to 59 chars, if the title works with the site identifier truncated.

## Description (Property)
* At least 130 characters long. 160 characters maximum, including spaces.  
* Important keywords at the front.
* Include phrases like “Learn about”,  “How to…”, “Find out about…”, “See steps for…”, “Get help with…”, and others to signal that this is documentation and people are going to learn something. As opposed to specs or marketing info. Something like:
  “Learn how to create a Power BI dashboard to visualize….”
* In CAPS, the template has no Description property, so the first paragraph will be the description, so it should follow these guidelines.

## (H1)
(If editable apart from page title; this is the title at the top of the article.)

* Recommended: 100 char max
* Don’t repeat the page title text verbatim.
* Strongest keywords at the beginning of the heading.

## 1st paragraph
* Use your strongest keywords in the first words of this paragraph.  - Make it short.
* Answer: What will the user learn or otherwise accomplish with this article?
* If the article has a good meta description, you can repeat it here.
* In CAPS, the template has no Description property, so this first paragraph will be the description and should follow the Description guidelines.

## Image file names
* Descriptive, real words, not abbreviations.
* 80-char pub system limit
* No underscores; use dashes.
  * YES: report-builder-parameter-tutorial-design.png
  * NO: ssRB_ParamTut_Desgn.png
  * NO: ssReportBuilderParameterTutorialDesign.png

## Image Alt text (Properties)
* 70 char maximum, including spaces
* Use your strongest keywords up front.
