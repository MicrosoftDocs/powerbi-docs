Measures in Power BI Designer

</font><p style="margin: 6pt 0in;"><span style="color: black; mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri;"><font face="Calibri" size="3">Power BI Designer helps you create
insights into your data with just a few clicks. But sometimes that data just
doesn’t include everything you need to answer some of your most important questions.
Measures can help you get there.</font></span></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p style="margin: 6pt 0in;"><font face="Calibri" size="3">Measures are used in some of the most common data analysis;
for example, sums, averages, minimum or maximum values, counts, or more
advanced calculations you create yourself using a DAX formula. The calculated
results of measures are always changing in response to your interaction with
your reports, allowing for fast and&nbsp;dynamic ad-hoc data exploration. Let’s take
a closer look.</font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

<font face="Calibri">In Power BI Designer, measures are created and used in
Report View. Measures you create yourself appear in the field list with a
calculator icon. You can name measures whatever you want, and add them to a new
or existing visualization just like any other field. </font></p><p style="margin: 6pt 0in;">

</font>Measures calculate a result from an expression formula. When
you create your own measures, you’ll use the Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)
formula language. DAX includes a library of over 200 functions, operators, and
constructs, providing immense flexibility in creating measures to calculate
results for just about any data analysis need. </p><p style="margin: 6pt 0in;"><font face="Times New Roman">

</font>DAX formulas are a lot like Excel formulas. DAX even has
many of the same functions like DATE, SUM, and LEFT. But, DAX’s functions are
meant to work with relational data like we have in Power BI Designer.</p><font face="Times New Roman"><h2><font face="Calibri">Let’s look at an example</font></h2><p style="margin: 6pt 0in;">

<font face="Calibri">Jan is a sales manager at Contoso. She’s been asked to provide
reseller sales projections over the next fiscal year. She decides to base her
estimates on last year’s sales amounts, with a six percent annual increase
resulting from various promotions that are scheduled over the next six months.</font></p><p style="margin: 6pt 0in;">

<font face="Calibri">To report the estimates, she imports last year’s sales data
by using Query in Power BI Designer. She finds the SalesAmount field in the
Reseller Sales table. Because the data she imported only contains sales amounts
for last year, she renames the SalesAmount field to Last Years Sales. She then
drag Last Years Sales onto the report canvas. It appears in a chart
visualization as single value that is the sum of all reseller sales from last
year. </font></p><p style="margin: 6pt 0in;">

<font face="Calibri">She notices that even though she did not specify a
calculation herself, one has been provided automatically. The designer created
its own measure by summing up all of the values in Last Years Sales. </font></p><p style="margin: 6pt 0in;">

<font face="Calibri">But, Jan needs a measure to calculate sales projections for
the coming year, which will be based on last year’s sales multiplied by 1.06 to
account for the expected 6 percent increase in business. For this calculation,
she’ll create her own measure. Using the New Measure feature, she creates a new
measure, then enters the following DAX formula: </font></p><blockquote>

<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><font face="Calibri">Projected Sales = SUM('Sales'[Last Years Sales])*1.06</font></b></blockquote><p style="margin: 6pt 0in;">

<font face="Calibri">Jan then drags her new Projected Sales measure into the
chart.</font></p><p style="margin: 6pt 0in;">

<span><img src="https://powerbi.uservoice.com/assets/79084935/MIPBID_3_ExampleChartWithProjectedSales.png"></span><br></p></font><p style="margin: 6pt 0in;"><font face="Times New Roman">

</font></p><p style="margin: 6pt 0in;">Very quickly and with minimal effort, Jan now has a measure
to calculate projected sales. She can<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;
</span>further analyze her projections by filtering on specific resellers or by
adding other fields to her report.</p><p style="margin: 6pt 0in;"><font face="Times New Roman">
