	<title>Q&A in Power BI</title>
	
	<div>Sometimes the fastest way to get an answer from your data, is to ask a question using natural language.&nbsp; For example, "what were total sales last year."&nbsp; Use Q&amp;A to explore your Excel data using intuitive, natural language capabilities and receive answers in the form of charts and graphs. Q&amp;A is different from a search engine --&nbsp;Q&amp;A only provides results about the data&nbsp;in Power BI. <br></div><div><br></div><div><span><img src="https://powerbi.uservoice.com/assets/76073806/PBI_Q&amp;A_BoxSalesSqFt.png"></span></div><div><br>How does Q&amp;A know how to answer data-specific questions? It&nbsp;relies on&nbsp;the names of the&nbsp;tables, columns, and calculated fields in a workbook or other dataset.&nbsp;So what you call things in your workbook is important! </div><div><br></div><div>Read more about <a href="http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/474690-how-to-make-q-a-work-with-your-data">preparing a workbook for Q&amp;A</a>, <a href="http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/424874-pin-a-tile-to-a-dashboard-from-the-question-box">pinning a tile to the dashboard from Q&amp;A</a>, and <a href="http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/475138-ask-the-right-questions-of-salesforce-data">asking the right questions of your Salesforce dataset</a>.<br></div><h2>Q&amp;A basic concepts</h2><p>The Q&amp;A text box is located at the top of&nbsp;a dashboard. To see and use&nbsp;Q&amp;A,&nbsp;a dashboard name must be selected in the navigation pane.</p><p><span><span><img src="https://powerbi.uservoice.com/assets/79798572/Q&amp;A%201.png"></span></span></p><p>As you type a question, Power BI Q&amp;A picks the best visualization to display your answer; and the visualization changes dynamically as you modify the question. </p><p>When you type a query, Power BI looks for an answer in any dataset that has a tile on that dashboard.&nbsp;&nbsp;If all the tiles are from <i>datasetA</i>, then your answer will come from <i>datasetA</i>.&nbsp; If&nbsp;there are tiles from <i>datasetA </i>and <i>datasetB</i>, then Q&amp;A will search for the best answer from those 2 datasets.</p><p><b>TIP</b>:&nbsp; So be careful, if you only have one tile from <i>datasetA </i>and you remove it from your dashboard, Q&amp;A will no longer have access to <i>datasetA</i>.</p><p>For more information, see <a href="http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/487029">Power BI - basic concepts</a>.<br></p><h2>Types of questions to ask of an uploaded Excel workbook</h2><p>When you have a workbook prepared for Q&amp;A, you are on your way to start asking questions. Here’s a sample of the types of questions you can ask:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Show &lt;table&gt;<br>Examples:<br>Show sales<br>Show orders<br><br></li><li>Average &lt;column&gt; (if the column has number values)<br>Example: Average employee age<br><br></li><li>Show &lt;column&gt;, where &lt;column&gt; is between &lt;range&gt;<br>Examples:<br>Show products, where price is between $10 and $30<br>Show sales, where date is between 2012 and 2014<br><br></li><li>Show &lt;column&gt;, where &lt;column&gt; is before &lt;value&gt;<br>Examples:<br>Show products, where date sold is before December 9th, 2014<br>Show employees, where date of birth is after 3/3/1985<br><br></li><li>&lt;measure&gt; by &lt;column name&gt;<br>a.&nbsp;Year over year growth by year <br>b.&nbsp;Total sales by product <br>c.&nbsp;Number of sales by location <br>d.&nbsp;Total profit and total cost by product <br><br></li><li>&lt;measure&gt; by &lt;column name&gt; for &lt;specific entity within another column&gt;&nbsp;<br>Example:&nbsp;Total sales by sales rep for Surface Pro 3 <br></li></ul><h2>See Also:</h2><p><a href="http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/487029-power-bi-preview-basic-concepts">Power BI - Basic Concepts</a><br><a href="http://support.powerbi.com/knowledgebase/articles/430814-get-started-with-power-bi">
